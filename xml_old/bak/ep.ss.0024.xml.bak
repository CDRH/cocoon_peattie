Nothing remained &#8212;except everything.  In that bewildered frame of mind whichaccompanies the passing away of college days, and the beginning ofa new heaven and a new earth, Dilling Brown had shown his aunt,Miss Elizabeth Brown, &#8212; his aunt who was also his guardian, &#8212;over the historic hills and around the campus, had introduced her toprofessors and told her yarns till she protested.</p><p>"You're just like one of those tiresome books of short stories,Dilling," she said.  "Can't you be a little more consecutive?  Youchop up my emotions so!"</p><p>Dilling shook back his too abundant hair, &#8212; it was a perfect haycolor, &#8212; and laughed with huge appreciation.  Then he took his auntover to drink tea with some friends while he went to look up a man.</p><p>The man, known to his associates as Tommy Letlow, was up inhis room packing his best silk hat.</p><p>"You darned dude!" cried Brown.</p><p>"La la la la la la," was Letlow's lyric greeting.  He spun round onone nimble heel and sparred at Brown.</p><p>"Shut up!" said Brown, reaching under his guard.  "Where areyou going, you sweep, when you leave these hacademic 'alls?"</p><p>Letlow looked glum.  "I don't know," he admitted.  "At least, myticket reads to New York.  Any one can <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to New York."</p><p>Brown forced his little companion back into a chair.</p><p>"But I want to rest easy nights."</p><p>"Rest in peace, son."</p><p>"I can't, unless you tell me more.  How are you going to stay inNew York after you get there?  Who've you got to look to &#8212; orafter?"</p><p>"Just my bloomin' self."</p><p>"And you haven't a million left out of your patrimony, eh?"</p><p>"Patrimony!  What a pretty word, Dil!  Mighty pretty word, that. Begins with a <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and sounds so pleasant.  No, there aren'tmillions.  But there was enough to buy a ticket to New York."</p><p>"Going to try a newspaper?"</p><p>"All fools walk the same road."  Letlow got at his packing andhis singing again.</p><p>"But my aunt says," broke in Brown, "that she wants you tocome up home with us for a time.  She wants you to help eat thefatted capon.  We go up to New York, too, and take a two-hour rundown Long Island, you know.  Aunt lives in a rotten little townthere, and raises boxwood.  At least, that is the impression to begathered from a casual glance at her front yard.  Her object in life isto keep Nettie from breaking the china which my grandfatherbrought from Canton fifty years ago, when he was in the trade. Nettie is a careless young thing who has been in the familyforty-three years.  Come along and see Nettie and the china and thecat and the boxwood; it would give me more pleasure than anythingI could think of.  Aunt Betty's a brick, &#8212; you won't find many likeher.  She has only one weakness &#8212; and that's me.  But we're the lastof our kind, and very rare and precious, so we attach a good deal ofimportance to each other.  Come on, Tommy.  Do it, eh?"</p><p>"Of course I will, you beggar!  Going to-night?  Five sharp? I'll be there.  Ladies' waiting room!  All right, Dil, my duck.  And<hi rend="italic">please</hi>, Dil, give my compliments to your aunt."</p><p>So the three settled down in the old<pb id="page322" />house beyond the boxwood, and the young men put in a good dealof time laughing about nothing in particular, and got themselves upin white flannel and played tennis afternoons with Anice Comstockand Dorcas Pilsbury, nice girls, whom Dilling had known since heknew anything.  Aunt Betty sat in the shade of the elms with Mrs.Pilsbury, and there were lemonade and seed cakes served &#8212; andnothing else happened.  No one did anything remarkable.  The girlswere quiet girls, who did not play tennis any too well, and whomade their own frocks.  They both thought the young men laughedtoo much, and wondered what they meant by their frivolous view ofthings.  Miss Dorcas asked Tommy Letlow, one evening, if he hadany religious convictions.  Poor Tommy, who was very fair, withsoft black curls on the top of his head and innocent deep blue eyes,looked like a little boy who has been scolded and is going to cry. But Miss Dorcas kept her eyes fixed on him, and he had to answer.</p><p>"Upon my soul, Miss Dorcas, I &#8212; really, Miss Dorcas, I can't say. I'd stick out the day's work, whatever it was, and keep alongsideanybody who expected me to, you know, and I wouldn't besurprised at anything that might happen on &#8212; on either side of thegrave, you know, Miss Dorcas.  What I have seen of the worldalready has been so surprising and so &#8212; so incomprehensible, thatthere are no &#8212; no miracles, you understand, Miss Dorcas, in myestimation.  Everything is a miracle, you see.  Only it was some oneelse who said that, wasn't it?"</p><p>"It was Walt Whitman," said Miss Dorcas quite severely.</p><p>"Was it, Miss Dorcas?  I'm glad to have quoted him, even if Ididn't know I was doing it.  It isn't my fault, you know, that I haven'tbeen better taught than I have about &#8212; what you were speaking of,you know, a minute ago.  If my mother had lived, I suppose I shouldhave been different.  But everybody is dead who took any interest inme, except Dil over there."</p><p>He looked quite wistful, and the girl rubbed the toe of her tennisshoe back and forth in the dust, with an air of wishing to saysomething comforting, but she only remarked: "Mr. Brown is a verypleasant young man," looking over to where Dilling and Miss Anicewere tossing balls languidly about the tennis court, "but he seems tolack earnestness."</p><p>Tommy went for lemonade just then, &#8212; the maid was bringing itout to the table under the elms, &#8212; and so he attempted no answer. He wondered so much over the meaning of Miss Dorcas's complaintabout the lack of earnestness in Dil and himself that he spilt half adozen drops of the lemonade on that young lady's lilac-spriggedgown, with instant obliteration of the lilac sprigs.  That evening hehad a temporary hope that Dil, at least, had some latent earnestnessin him, by which he might be justified to his gentle critics, for heheard him saying: &#8212;</p><p>"Well, aunt Betty, dear, I must get out of this.  Tommy and I aregoing to seek our fortunes.  We are going to walk down the road tillwe meet a man, and we are going to say, 'Please, good man, give ussome straw, that we may build us a house.'  And the good man" &#8212;</p><p>"Dil, what nonsense!  Sit up, sir."  Dil got off the sofa and placedhimself with undue solemnity in one of his aunt's gothic-backedchairs.  Tommy had fears that this earnestness was not yet of thequality to recommend itself to the young lady with the spriggedlawn.  Miss Elizabeth Brown continued to address her nephew: "Iwant to say to you, Dilling, what I have not said before, &#8212; that I wasmightily pleased with you Commencement Day.  I was pleased withwhat you said, and with the way you bore yourself, and with thereports I got of you."</p><pb id="page323" /><p>"Oh come, aunt Betty dear, this is too bad!  What have I done todeserve this at your hands?"</p><p>"Don't laugh, Dil.  If your father could have lived to hear and seeyou, my satisfaction would have been complete.  Of course I am notgoing around crowing over you.  This is all between ourselves andMr. Letlow.  Didn't you notice how offhand and deprecating I was,the other day?  But in fact, Dil, and quite seriously, I was and am sopleased that it gives me grace to make a great sacrifice."</p><p>"You have never done anything else but make sacrifices."</p><p>"Many of the things you may have called by that name wererefined forms of self-indulgence, my dear."</p><p>"Oh ho!" he laughed, with flattering irony.</p><p>"But now I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> going to make a sacrifice.  I'm going togive you what's coming to you out of the property, Dilling, and letyou choose for yourself what you will do with it.  I've got a littleannuity fixed up for myself, and with the old home and the gardenand all, I shall live like a queen, &#8212; a queen with economicaltendencies.  The over and above goes to you, and I have decidedthat it would better be yours now instead of several years from now. It's all arranged for, and Mr. Effingwell &#8212; our solicitor, Mr. Letlow&#8212; is coming in the morning.  Mr. Letlow's presence in the library atten o'clock would be a favor.  There's the house and the plate andthe mahogany and my laces to settle about.  They may not meanmuch to you, Dilling, but some day you may have a wife who willappreciate them.  Now, the worst of it is that the sum I can offer youis not sufficient to permit you to settle down among old friends inthis part of the country and make any showing, but it is enough totake you away to some new &#8212; and probably disagreeable &#8212; part ofthe world, to accumulate experience and, I hope, property."</p><p>The young man murmured something inarticulate.  His bold eyeswere a trifle moist and his lips looked unnatural, as though he weretrying to be superior to human emotion with very poor success.  Hewas a strapping fellow, with shoulders a degree too high, a largehead, a thick neck, and an obstinate chin; but his brow showedideality and imagination, and his smile would have won a hangmanto friendliness.  His aunt went on: &#8212;</p><p>"I'm gratified, too, to see that you do not become sentimentalover every girl you meet."  Letlow, who sat apart, feeling ratherremote from his kind, grinned at this.  "It gives me confidence inyou.  Incidentally, it reminds me of certain air castles which I havebeen building in weak moments.  I could not deny myself thepleasure of picturing a summer vacation with you down at Martha'sVineyard, or some place where we were sure to meet a lot of peoplewe knew.  I indulged in fancies of the pretty triumphs you wouldhave, of a nature which it is not now necessary to enlarge upon, andhow I should rejoice in the light of reflected popularity.  I tried topersuade myself that this would be the best thing for you, and that Ishould be almost certain to run across some old friend who wouldhelp me to place you just right, &#8212; something in the wholesale line,you know, or something journalistic or scientific."</p><p>Letlow choked on some unknown substance, and the muscles ofDilling's face worked slightly.  There was a break in the lady's voiceas she continued: &#8212;</p><p>"But I know all that was cowardly, Dil, and that you'd want toface the issue &#8212; I mean the &#8212; the exigency.  You're just like yourfather about that.  He always felt moved to face a situation,particularly if it was very disagreeable.  Now, you think the matterover, decide what you want to do, and go and do it."  The tonebecame quite brisk and businesslike at this point.</p><pb id="page324" /><p>"You'll go out and make discoveries, &#8212; countries and men andwomen, or a woman &#8212; and Heaven knows what of sorrow and joy. But as for me, there are no discoveries that I care to make in thisworld.  I never did attach so much importance to knowledge assome do.  There's only time to acquire an infinitesimal bit at thebest, and it doesn't answer the questions a woman is reallyinterested in, when you get it.  No one is wise enough to answer theimportant questions.  One must take everything that is reallyimportant on faith.  I'm sending you away in faith, Dilling.  I expectgood things of you; not necessarily great things.  Great things aredisturbing and very pronounced, Dil.  I don't care for you to bepronounced."</p><p>The young man laughed through a lump in his throat, lifted theslender old hand to his lips, and left the room.  Letlow, whoremained behind, wondered why he had not been fortunate enoughto have some one incoherent over <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.  He arose, with hishands in his pockets, and walked up and down the floor once ortwice.  Then he stopped beside Miss Betty.  The tears were rollingdown her cheeks.  He stood a moment regarding them, then stoopedvery tenderly and wiped them away.  Miss Betty glanced up, andperceived the look in his face.</p><p>"My dear son!" she exclaimed, instinctively using the word heneeded.  He sank almost unconsciously on his knees.  "God blessyou and keep you in the ways of righteousness," she said, her handson his head.  Then he too went out of the room.</p><p>Miss Betty sat for several minutes, letting the tears fall withoutchecking them.  Then she arose and looked about the room as if shehad never seen it before.  She observed its quaint orderliness, itsodd, beautiful old furnishings, its non-committal tones.  She lookedat herself, undersized, quaint and plain too, like her environment, asshe was reflected in the gilt-framed mirror between the windows. She noted the thinness of her hair about the temples, saw the loose,yellow folds of flesh about the neck, smiled at the inconsistency ofthe pearls upon her hand, &#8212; they had been given her long ago by aman who went to India, and who, going once with a promise on hislips, never returned because of a tidal wave on some forgottenshore, &#8212; and then she wound the old clock, standing on a stool to doit, closed the windows, closed the door, lighted a candle, and blewout the lamps.</p><p>"I shall be more lonely than I have ever been before," she said tothe clock.</p><p>She climbed the stairs slowly, very slowly, and halfway up shestopped.  "It must be," she murmured, "that I have forgottensomething, &#8212; the windows or the clock."  So she went back, pickingher way on the polished stairs.  But she had neglected nothing, andshe crept up the stairs again, scolding herself with impatient "tut tuttuts."</p><p>An hour later she lay in bed, still with wide-open eyes.  The doorof her room was pushed back softly, and she saw Dilling creepingin.  She made a feint of sleeping.  In another moment he was gone,and a soft perfume saluted her.  She put out her hand, and there wasa bunch of mignonette on her pillow.</p><p>"He has great perception," she commented to herself.  "Heunderstands women.  When he makes up his mind to win a woman,he will win her.  But I'm glad he doesn't fall in love with everyfoolish child he meets."</p><p>Up in Letlow's room the young men were debating the affairs oflife gravely, and canvassing various occupations and chances forinvestment.</p><p>"Well, anyhow," said Dilling in conclusion, &#8212; a conclusion atwhich no conclusions had been reached, &#8212; "I'm glad I let dear auntBet take the lead.  I've been fuming to be in the harness ever sincewe got home, and a good while before, for the matter of that.  But Ibethought me that the least I could do<pb id="page325" />was to let aunt Betty enjoy the idea of having set me in motion.  Shelikes authority, and I didn't want to deprive her of the exercise of theleast particle of it, you see."</p><p>"I see, Dil.  I see you're a shade too adroit.  Now I should neverthink of that, &#8212; not in ten thousand years.  If you ever start out towin a woman, Dil, you will win her all right enough."  Whichinference, it will be remembered, had once before been drawn underthat roof, that evening.</p><p>"I hope so &#8212; devoutly!  If I ever do see a woman I want, Tommy,Heaven have mercy on her.  But why speak of women?  You arebetter than many women, Tommy."</p></div2><div2 type="chapter"><head>II.</head><p>"Coo-ee!  Coo-ee!  Coo-ee!"</p><p>Dilling Brown sent out the long, wavering sheep call inunaccustomed tones.  He had ridden five days beside the sheep, andslept four nights in the midst of them.  With him were two blondmen, long-haired, blue-eyed, dressed in khaki ponchos, corduroytrousers, buff leather leggins, sombreros, and spurs, &#8212; above all,spurs.  Each carried two pistols in his belt and a rifle slung acrosshis saddle.  Also there followed twelve good dogs and true, &#8212;shepherds every one.  Finally came one sallow heathen, Li Lung,commissariat, driving the mules of the supply wagon.</p><p>They were bound for the Edge of Things where the free grassgrew &#8212; past the ranches in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, pastthe leased land of the big sheep ranges, out to the "common"thoughtfully provided by the legislature of California.</p><p>"And now," asked the government, "what earthly objection canthere be to free wool?  Isn't it time we got over being provincial, weprovincials?  See, we give you a chance for clear profit.  Go, mysons, and become very rich."</p><p>Dilling Brown was pleased at the suggestion, and adopted it. That was why he was driving with Big Hank &#8212; otherwise HenryNettle &#8212; and Cross-Eyed Kit &#8212; otherwise Christopher Huggins &#8212;along the trackless waste of the Californian desert.  He had enteredupon his venture with intelligence, so he congratulated himself.  Hemight have picked his sheep on the western slopes of the Sierras,but, hearing of a lot across the range, he preferred to take hischances with them, rather than run the risks attendant upon crossingthe pass.  The sheep were a good lot, all Cotswolds; a little thin andjaded from removal, but capable of being put in prime condition. So Cross-Eyed Kit opined; and when it came to a pronunciamentoupon sheep from Cross-Eyed Kit, there were none to gainsay.</p><p>At the last ranch Brown was urged to stay overnight, and heconsented.</p><p>"I'm eager to see what's before me," he said, "but not so eagerthat I'll not be glad to accept your hospitality."</p><p>Papin, the overseer at the Esmeralda ranch, &#8212; you can tell theEsmeralda sheep by two notches in the left ear, &#8212; smiledenigmatically, and looked Brown straight in the eyes.</p><p>"There's plenty of time," protested he.</p><p>"Time!" cried Brown, with the smile that won men's hearts. "There's nothing but time and sheep.  That's all they have out in thiscountry, isn't it?"</p><p>"And these."  Papin passed the cigars.  Brown fingered one andsniffed it.  "Ah!" said he.  "It is difficult to escape civilization."</p><p>"I'm glad you like the brand.  We manage to make ourselvesrather comfortable here.  This ranch belongs to Leonard and Filbinof San Francisco.  They're in everything pretty much, &#8212; mines andmills and sheep and what not.  I've been managing for them forthree years now, and we've eight thousand merinos out at grass, anda force of fifty men, first and last."</p><pb id="page326" /><p>Dilling smoked and looked about him.  The house was adobe,and it rambled over an unconscionable amount of ground.  An arrayof fantastic cacti writhed and twisted about the little compound infront, and as they showed symmetry in their arrangement, it wassafe to infer that this was some one's idea of a flower garden.</p><p>"It's the sort of a flower garden I should expect the devil tohave," thought Dilling.</p><p>The overseer had his rooms on one side of the house, the officein the centre, and beyond the quarters for the men, between whomand the overseer, as the newcomer already fully appreciated,discipline and custom fixed a deep gulf.  This amused him.  Thatthe wilderness should have an aristocracy and an etiquette heconsidered to be "worth the price of admission," as he had confidedto one man.  But the man had not laughed, and then Brown came toa realizing sense that it does not do to be amused at a country tillyou are out of it.</p><p>His present host was a tall, firmly knit American, with a hint ofsomething French about him.  Dilling admired the type,remembering what the men who belonged to it had done inAmerica.  It stood for much daring and adventure.  The man hadperception, too, &#8212; enough to persuade him to silence while his guesttook cognizance of things about him.  After a time a Chinamanappeared at the door, and with a single blow on a tiny tom-tomannounced supper.</p><p>"Wait ten minutes longer, Sam," said Papin.  "I hear the mencoming, and I want this gentleman to see them."</p><p>The Chinaman grinned, and held up the tom-tom knowingly forsilence.  Brown had been conscious for several seconds thatsomething unusual was happening to his eardrum.  Now hediscovered that this persistent concussion was the even andrhythmical hammering of the plain by a body of advancing horse. The east was golden, catching its splendor from the burnished west,and out of the lesser glory rode the herders, four abreast on theirbroncos, without swerve.</p><p>"By Jove!" cried Brown, standing up, "that's fine!"</p><p>As the men came nearer the spectacle grew more imposing.  Thelittle beasts under the men flung their legs with a strangeoutreaching motion, and every animal went without a check, hisnose groundward.  The men were a trifle above the average height,and their hair, long and much cared for, floated in the breeze madeby their riding.  They looked very handsome, helped out as theywere by the background of illumined space.</p><p>"Good boys!  Good boys!" said Papin proudly.  "They're quite abody of men, Mr. Brown, and easy to manage, though they havetheir peculiarities like the rest of us.  A small guard of men doeswith the sheep at night, and most of the dogs stay with the herd,though some of them come home each night.  And they're asanxious as the men to get their turn off."</p><p>The herders were running their horses into the corral, and LouisPapin took his guest out to the dining room.  There was a goodmeal, well served, &#8212; a meal with salad and wine, &#8212; and under itsinfluence the ranchman became sympathetic.</p><p>"It isn't just what I would choose for a young man," he said,speaking of Brown's venture, "but of course, now you're in for aspell of ranching, the only thing you can do is to get all you can outof the experience."</p><p>"What's the seamy side?"</p><p>"Oh, what you might expect: loneliness, and no women, and nonews, and no coming and going of your kind.  The sheep wear onyou, after a time.  They're not like cattle, &#8212; haven't got themovement nor the brains.  You've seen the Sargasso Sea?  No? Well, you've seen moving masses of seaweed.  The sheep remindme of them at times, &#8212; a writhing, restless, half-alive, wholly<pb id="page327" />unintelligent body.  I don't know as the men feel that way about it. Besides, it's not so hard on them, &#8212; this life.  They have good timestogether.  It's different when a man's placed as I am.  Some of theowners settle on their ranches and bring their families out.  There'sVenner, impresario for Stebbins of Los Angeles, who has his familywith him.  But I've no family to bring, so I make up my accounts,and look after the men, and ride about among the sheep, and attendto a thousand and one details.  Sometimes the men get sick and haveto be taken care of.  Once in a while an epidemic of homesicknessbreaks out, and that's harder to deal with than the fever.  Now andthen they quarrel, but I keep out of their fights.  And, on the whole,they regulate themselves very well."</p><p>So he rambled on cheerfully, giving Brown an idea of the life. Dilling ventured some confidences on his own account, and theolder man received them almost in silence, regarding his guest witha look which, had he been in any sort of hard luck, Dilling wouldhave interpreted as pitying.  They went out to the quarters, later,passing down the long room where the men bunked, to the eatingroom.  They were all smoking there together, and two Chinamenwere clearing away the remains of the meal.  Dilling stopped on thethreshold, and looked about him with unfeigned enjoyment of a newscene.</p><p>The long low room, crowded with muscular fellows, blondalmost to the last man of them, with streaming, delicate hair, facesthe color of their saddles, and a manner born of breaking theirhorses, managing their sheep, and fearlessly looking the wildernessin the face, was a thing to see and to remember.  The smile withwhich Dilling made visible record of his interest won, as itinvariably did, friends for him at the minute.  The men smiled back,and they frankly took cognizance of him, and liked the way he was"put up" and the bold and amiable eyes with which he returned theirglances.</p><p>"Well," said Papin in a patriarchal tone, "I've quite a family, Mr.Brown."</p><p>Brown let out his characteristic roar of laughter at this, and themen found it infectious.  So there was good feeling established.</p><p>"They are always pleased when my visitors talk with them,"murmured Louis Papin under his breath to his guest.  "It's a dull lifethey lead, poor boys, and a new story pleases them to the core."</p><p>Brown nodded, still keeping his eyes on the men.</p><p>"So these are what you cal shepherds!" he cried gayly.  "Ithought shepherds dressed in pink and white china, and always wentwith little blue and white shepherdesses, and played on reeds, likethis," and he made a mimic piping with his lips, &#8212; a trick he hadlearned from an English boy. . .</p><p>"Go on!" shouted the men.  "Go on!  Give us some more music. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> don't need no cornet.  Keep 'er up."</p><p>"Not till I have seen the shepherdesses!" persisted Brown. "Where are the shepherdesses?"</p><p>The men chuckled, pleased as school-boys.</p><p>"Now, how t' dickens did the fellow know they were likechildren?" Papin was wondering to himself.  "He's adroit &#8212; but Isaw that from the first.  He could manage anybody.  He ought to besomewhere else, &#8212; not down here among the cactus.  Poor cuss, it'sa sorry fate for him.  What a waste the girls must think it, &#8212; himamong the cactus!"  When he emerged from his reflections, Brownwas singing Little Bo Peep according to a college version.</p><p>"That's positively the only song I know which refers to your &#8212;your profession," he bowed as the men applauded him.</p><p>"Goin' t' try ranchin' it, sir?" asked one of the men, respectful butcurious.</p><p>Brown seated himself on the edge of<pb id="page328" />the table, the better to look over his audience.</p><p>"I'll explain myself," he said frankly.  "I'm just out of college,and in the soup.  That's why I came here to raise sheep."</p><p>"That's right!  Here's the place t' be under them circumstances."</p><p>"And if you're wanting some stories" &#8212;</p><p>"Put it thar, pard!"</p><p>"&#8212; why, the only sort of yarns I know are college yarns.  And Ican sing college songs.  If you want those" &#8212;  But there was wildencouragement with whistlings and caterwauls, and it was almostmidnight when he left.</p><p>"You've made yourself solid," declared Papin, as he shook handswith his guest at the chamber door that night.  "If you ever get introuble, let my men know it, and they'll be with you."</p><p>As the men rolled in their bunks that night, laughing andrepeating snatches of the ringing nonsensical songs that Brown hadgiven them, they remarked with freedom, and sometimes withunnecessary emphasis, "That there coot's a gentleman.  No up-in-the-balloon-boys about him.  He's right on your own level, he is. He's the real thing!"  All of which was an involved way of sayingthat Brown's manners were what they ought to be.</p><p>Breakfast was served at dawn at the Esmeralda, and the east was"blossomed in purple and red" when Brown stood before the doorwith his host, watching the men get up their ponies.</p><p>"How far do you intend to ride beyond this?" asked the manager.</p><p>"God knows," said Brown.  "I ride till I come to grass which isno other man's, but mine by the courtesy of the state of California."</p><p>Papin called up a genial-looking fellow with saddle-bowed legs.</p><p>"Where is that empty adobe you were telling me of, the otherday, Bob?  The one young Cusack and his sister had."</p><p>"Going with the sheep, sir, it would be a day's ride east,"responded the man, touching the edge of his sombrero, "and half aday's ride south.  It can't be missed, for to reach it you turn at thechaparral beyond the Salita arroyo, and follow that due south."</p><p>"Can you remember that, Mr. Brown?" asked Papin, with asmile.</p><p>"Of course.  It's a house that I might feel at liberty to occupy?  Itwould save me a good deal of bother if I could."</p><p>"It's yours when you hang up your hat.  Fred Cusack and hissister were there for a time."</p><p>"What made them leave?"</p><p>The herder started to speak, but Papin frowned and shook hishead at him.</p><p>"Cusack lost his health," he said shortly.  "That will do, Bob. Tell the boys to mount.  I want Mr. Brown to see you ride off."</p><p>A minute later there was a sound that made the blood rush toBrown's face, &#8212; a long, wavering, fierce cry, the war cry of theApaches.  But it was not the Apaches who made it.  It was fortylong-locked men, riding four abreast into the incarnadined east; andthey went madly, fast as equine legs could take them over the dustyplain, and as they went they yelled.  Brown stood fascinated till thedust hid the men; and even then the wild, wavering cry came back.</p><p>"My powers!" said he, dropping into a chair and taking a cup ofcoffee from the smiling Chinaman, "it's good to be alive and to haveseen that!"</p><p>Louis Papin looked at the boy and flushed a little.  Then heglanced down half humorously at his own beard, and carefullydrawing out a white hair from the midst of it, he laid it on the palmof his hand and regarded it sentimentally.</p><p>"It certainly is good to be young &#8212; as you are, Mr. Brown."</p><p>"Why, as you are, too, Mr. Papin!  What can you mean, sir, bythinking<pb id="page329" />yourself anything else but young?"  He looked in unfeignedastonishment at the strong, firm, keen man before him.</p><p>"I have a malady," confessed Papin, "and it has aged me."</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"Shall I tell you the name of it?"</p><p>"Why, if you please, Mr. Papin."</p><p>"It is a fatal thing.  Eventually it causes ossification of the &#8212; ofthe heart."</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"Yes, there is such a thing.  Or it causes softening of the brain.  Itis an inextinguishable ennui."</p><p>He spoke with such solemnity that Brown was forced to looksympathetic, though when he heard the nature of Papin's allegeddisorder, he could with difficulty keep from smiling.</p><p>"But why have you not married, sir, and surrounded yourselfwith a family?  Or brought some man out here to rough it with you? There are young fellows who would thank their stars for a chance tobe with a man like you, and to get blooded to this life."</p><p>Papin smiled sadly.  "I'm not so egotistical," he said, "as tosuppose that I could console any one &#8212; any one &#8212; no matter whatour relations might be, for the loss of the whole world."</p><p>His head dropped a little, and he and Brown sat in silence,drinking their coffee and smoking.</p><p>"It must be that he has had some confounded tragedy," thoughtBrown pityingly.  "A woman, no doubt.  Jove, but some men do getawfully cut up!  May my day be long a-coming!"</p><p>An hour later, with his sheep, his men, and his dogs, he rode intothe east.  It was all a mist of dull golden dustiness, and the skyabove was a pale and half-obscured blue.  It was the air and the skyof the Californian desert in the dry season.  Brown was to becomevery well acquainted with it.</p><p>"A day east to the chaparral," called Papin, "then half a daysouth to the adobe house, going at the pace the sheep set.  Good-by,Brown, good-by and good luck."</p><p>"Good-by, sir.  I'll not forget the savor of your bread and salt."</p><p>As he went out, riding slowly beside the trotting sheep, one ofthe dogs came up and leaped about him, barking.</p><p>"What is it, girl?" he said absently.  "What do you want?"  Thedog had a benevolent face, with a pleasing breadth between theeyes, a delicate tapering of the nose, a well-rounded brow, and anarrow-shaped spot of white at the base of the brain.  Her feet andbelly were a bright tan.  Brown scrutinized her for several seconds.</p><p>"Your face reminds me of aunt Betty's," he said aloud, and hissoliloquy was the first token that he was amid the solitudes of earthand that his sub-consciousness appreciated it, &#8212; "though I don'tknow whether or not the dear old lady would feel complimented tohear me say so.  But I'm going to name you Bet.  Hear that?  Bet! Bet!  Yes, that's you, girl.  Why, you're a pleasant creature.  What isit that you want, anyway?  You flirt, I believe you're trying to makeup to me.  You want to be my dog, eh?  My favorite?  Well, well,that's a good doggie.  That's all right.  So, so, Bet.  That's what youwant, is it?"</p><p>He had brought his pony to a stop to rub the dog's head; butwhen she had submitted to the caressing for a moment, she ran on toinform her friends, vociferously, of the event.  Some of the dogslooked back curiously, but others went haughtily on, as if theywould have nothing to do with toadies.  Then Bet snapped at a ram,who, with his long fleece hanging about him, looked as benevolentas a patriarch; meaning to show by this exhibition of authority thatshe was the special dog of the master.</p><p>"This seems to be pretty good society that I'm moving in,"thought Brown.  "Here, Bet, come here!"</p><p>Bet fairly leaped with pride at this<pb id="page330" />imperative summons, and came back to run along by his side.</p><p>Then the sheep got to wandering, and Bet's sharp bark arousedBrown once more to a sense of his duties.  He flanked the restlessbody of animals, and, putting his hand to his mouth, recalled thestragglers.</p><p>"Coo-ee!  Coo-ee!  Coo-ee!"</p></div2><div2 type="chapter"><head>III.</head><p>Within a week Dilling Brown was settled in his new home.  Atleast, he had settled all save one room in it.  The house was ofadobe, built on three sides of a square.  The open side of the squarestood toward the west, and within the court was one stunted anddusty gum tree.  A quarter of a mile to the east ran a belt ofchaparral, composed of pine scrub, and most fatally a trap for theCotswolds, whose long hair became easily entangled.  To keep thesheep out of this snare was the task of dogs and men; and as thesheep could never learn a lesson, though they lived to be older thanany crocodile of the Ganges, their shepherds had a hard time of it. Brown had too small a force, as a matter of fact, considering histwelve hundred sheep, but it was all he could afford, and he did acommon herder's work himself to help make up the deficiency.  Thedogs proved to be as fine a pack as man could wish.  Brown couldstand upon a hillock and whistle, and in two seconds every softcanine eye would be turned in his direction.  Then he had only toindicate by a gesture to the right or the left what sheep neededrecalling, and they were recalled.  If any dog was lax in his duty,Bet saw to his instant punishment.</p><p>It was evident that the house which Brown had taken possessionof had been vacated suddenly.  The furniture still stood in therooms, though indeed it was such poor stuff that it would have beenworth the while of no one to cart it back to civilization.  But manypersonal effects remained which would certainly have been takenaway, had not the occupants departed in haste and confusion whichrendered them indifferent to their belongings.</p><p>The room which Dilling had left undisturbed, and into which hehad put nothing of his own, was at the northwest corner of thehouse, and it was a bed-room.  One window, sunk deep in the adobewall, looked toward the north over miles upon miles of undulating,broad-leafed grass.  On the window ledge was a dusty wickerworkbasket, and in it thread and other accessories of such aconvenience, including a thimble.  It was a common little thimbleof celluloid, worth, in the coin of the commonwealth, about threecents.  Dilling tried it on his smallest finger, and it would not cap it. The narrow iron bed was thick with dust, and the young man stoodbefore it several seconds trying to realize that it had once beendainty and fresh.  There was a dressing table made of a packing box,draped, like the bed, with sheer white stuff; but the articles whichonce designated its use were gone, save a folding mirror which hungabove it, suspended by a blue ribbon.  A low chair stood before thetable, and by the window was a rocker.  Some rude but graceful jugswere on a shelf above the small fireplace, and it was evident that theformer occupant of the room had experimented in elementalceramics.  There were no pictures.  Two things more remained tosuggest the personality of her who had used the room.  One was alittle riding glove which lay forlornly under the bed, and whichBrown rescued from its plight, placing it on the dusty dressing table. The other was an inscription in rambling letters upon the wall abovethe fireplace.  It was well done, &#8212; the lettering, &#8212; with a bold hand:&#8212;</p><p>"He, watching over Israel, slumbereth not nor sleeps."</p><pb id="page331" /><p>"A curious thing for a young girl to write," mused Brown,regarding it; "but perhaps she needed to be reminded of that fact,out here.  It might be easy to forget most things, I should think, &#8212;even the religion of one's fathers.  I suppose she put it there for asort of stationary sermon."</p><p>He sat down in the rocker, and looked across space &#8212; dusty greenbeneath, dusty blue above &#8212; to the place where the blue came downand touched the green all in a blur of dustiness.</p><p>"But I wonder," he reflected at the end of ten minutes, "if she<hi rend="italic">was</hi> a young girl.  And I wonder if it is possible that Papincould tell me."</p><p>The fourth day of his residence in his new home, Brown fastenedthe rear door of this room, so that no one could enter it.  The otherdoorway led into the room which had obviously been used for asitting room, and which Brown employed for the same purpose. There was no door in the opening, so he made a portiere of gunnysacking and hung it up.  He regarded this with satisfaction for twoevenings.  Then it occurred to him that it was severely plain.  So hetook some dull red paint and smudged lizards on it, &#8212;conventionalized lizards.</p><p>"My uncle, but that looks decorative!" said Brown, with pride. "I fancy that would have pleased her immensely.  She seems to havehad a decided feeling for the picturesque."  He smoked and regardedhis work at leisure.  "I really think she'd feel pleased, if she couldsee it," he remarked again.</p><p>He got some letters from home, a month later.  There was a largepackage of them, with papers and magazines.  Papin wasresponsible for this boon, for he had arranged to send mail acrossthe desert in relays, each man forwarding it from his ranch to thenext, till the outposts were reached.  It was he who had thought toadd to the list of the exiled the name of the man at the Edge ofThings.  The letters from aunt Betty were very beautiful to him,though full of half-concealed jealousy of his new interests, and apatient wonder why he could not manage to reach the mail at leastevery other day.  She was well pleased, however, at the work he hadchosen for himself, and she imagined soft green pastures withrunning brooks, and a pretty painted farmhouse with muslin curtainsat the windows.  Dilling got some grim amusement out of the idea. He was sitting on a bench in the court at the time, for it was noon,and by the side of the eastern wall was to be found the only inch ofshade.  The Chinaman had done the best he could to make the placeclean, but the dust drifted in everywhere, and as Dilling lookedabout him, and then re-read his aunt's letters, and thought of thedifference between the mental picture entertained by the dear ladyand the sweltering and desolate reality, a wave of homesicknesscame along, and, being unexpected, it nearly swept him off his feet,figuratively speaking.  He came very near doing something whichhe had not done since he was a boy, and to save himself he had tobe violent.  So he said: "Damn that gum tree!"  And he darted aglance at it which carried yet more fervent maledictions.  It wascertainly a miserable gum tree, shriveled and begrimed with dust,and out of place in a land which endeavored conscientiously todevote itself to scrub pine and grass.</p><p>"I'd even play tennis with those lemonade girls, and be glad to doit," thought poor Dilling, laughing at his own discomfiture.</p><p>Li Lung, he of the kitchen, put out his old ivory head to see whatthe gentleman meant by talking when there was no one with whomto speak.  Then he nodded sagely, and made a cool drink with waterand claret, and set it in the inner room, to coax the gentleman out ofthe sun.</p><p>But Dilling was a long, long way from discouragement.  Hethought he saw a bright future for himself.  The sheep<pb id="page332" />were prospering.  The men with him proved to be faithful and tounderstand their business.  The dogs were a good lot, and Bet wasall that a friend could be.  So, if time dragged a trifle, it did notmatter.  If the dawns were somewhat too vivid, the days toomonotonous with their pale gold dustiness, the land breezes of thenight a hint too oppressive, and the stars somewhat too silent andslow in their rising and setting, it was all an incident.  He had cometo secure for himself an independency, and in an ancient andhonorable fashion, &#8212; a fashion that was ancient and honorable whenDavid of the hills of Bethlehem was young.  Dilling looked abouthim, made up his mind that he had done well, set his shoulders adegree nearer the square, and remarked to Bet that he was all right.</p><p>"Though I do wish, Bet," he said, "that the music of the sphereswould make itself audible.  I wouldn't care if they buzzed likesawmills, old doggie, so they broke up this silence.  Bark, Bet, bark,&#8212; yap, you miserable girl!  Make a noise, I say!"  And Betobediently insulted the moon with opprobrious remarks, as theblood-red planet showed her head above the chaparral.</p><p>Letlow wrote that he was doing a reporter's work on a New Yorkdaily, and making a fool of himself generally.  He had an idea ofgoing up to see aunt Betty before autumn was over.  He promised toplay tennis, too, for old time's sake.  "Though I find," hesupplemented, "that there are girls even in New York.  There is, forexample, one named" &#8212;  But after all, it is not necessary to betrayLetlow's secrets.  Dilling got to thinking, of course, of the foolishdays of the tennis court, and he wondered why he had laughed somuch.  No wonder Dorcas Pilsbury had asked Tommy if he had anyreligious convictions!  "No doubt she'd think me serious enoughnow, if she could see me," he reflected.  <hi rend="italic">She</hi> was serious,and so was Anice Comstock, with her kind gray eyes.  What a briskfrou-frou her skirts used to make when she ran about the tennisground, and what cunning little feet she had, as they showed in herwhite tennis shoes!  Anice Comstock was certainly much nicer thanDorcas Pilsbury.  But there were many nice things back in "therotten old town," &#8212; aunt Betty's fragrant tea at five of the afternoon,and aunt Betty pouring it, and smiling and chatting, and the pipingof bluebirds without in the elms, and Sundays at the old church, and&#8212; and Anice Comstock.  He fell into a reverie which lasted a longtime, and at the conclusion of it he was conscious of a definite idea. It was that Anice Comstock would not have written, "He, watchingover Israel, slumbereth not nor sleeps," in an adobe house in a sun-cursed desert.  Not but that Anice was good enough to have writtenit.  She was, indeed, a sort of angel, with starched drapery (Dillingcould not get that frou-frou out of his memory); but she wasn't anangel with a knowledge of the desert, or what was needed forcomfort in the desert, and that happened to be just the sort ofwoman that he was pleased to think about then.</p><p>It so chanced that Louis Papin came up, three weeks after this, tosee how Brown was getting on.  They spent two days together, andenjoyed themselves.  Papin had his tattered Shakespeare with him,&#8212; but hasn't that been mentioned before?  The rag of a book wasalways with him.  The two read from that; and they smoked; andthere is always poker wherever there is civilized man.  But fromfirst to last, Brown bided his chance.  At last it came.</p><p>"The Cusacks were very obliging to leave this snug house foryou, eh, Brown?"</p><p>"Very.  I'd like to thank them.  Do you know where they are?"</p><p>"No-o, &#8212; not exactly."</p><p>"And the girl, &#8212; was she young?  Miss Cusack, I mean."</p><pb id="page333" /><p>"Katherine Cusack?  Oh yes, she was young, &#8212; quite young.  Afine brave girl.  Had the spirit of a man in her."</p><p>"That's your arrogance.  It was probably the spirit of a woman, ifit was brave."</p><p>"Very likely.  She was beautiful, too, in a way; small, but strong,and exceedingly active, and always saying the unexpected thing.  Isaw her twice: once when she went past my place coming out here,and &#8212; when she came back."</p><p>"Why didn't you see her more?" questioned Brown, withsomething like asperity.</p><p>"Why, to tell the truth, man, I thought &#8212; I thought I'd better mindmy own business.  Not that I wanted to."</p><p>There were a hundred more questions that Brown meant to ask,but Papin got off on another lead, and Brown could not get himback again.</p></div2><div2 type="chapter"><head>IV.</head><p>As the weeks went on, trailing along as slowly as woundedsnakes, as the wool lengthened on the sheep, and the hair hunglower on the shoulders of the herders, and the peculiarities of everyanimal became known, and all the papers and magazines were readover and over again, the propriety of that sentence in the roombehind the gunny sacking porti&#232;re became more and moreapparent.</p><p>When Dilling rode up from the sheep, sun-blinded, foul withdust and sweat, and weary from the saddle, he got into the way ofgoing to that room before supper, because he derived a warm senseof companionship from the thought of the girl who had once beenthere, and from the atmosphere that still made of it an oasis in abarren land.  The excellent and cleanly heathen had restored themuslins of the little northwest room to their native state, for whichDilling was disproportionately grateful; for now the room looked asif it might, at any hour, welcome its mistress.  Dilling could lookabout, seem to salute an invisible presence, and then lift his eyes tothe message on the wall, which, in the course of long and yet longerdays, began to have the deepest of meanings for him, so that thesoul of him, there in the wilderness, submitted itself and was atpeace with its Maker.</p><p>Then the days for shearing came on, and actively hard workserved as a diversion, besides which it aroused the youngranchman's drooping hope.  The results of his deprivations and toilwere almost apparent, he told himself.  He would presently knowthe satisfaction that arises from accumulating herds.  He would holdhonestly acquired money in his hands, and the bitterness of thesolitude would be partly compensated for.  As, day by day, theshearlings multiplied in number, and the clad sheep grew fewer, thisfeeling of contentment increased.  The long clipped wool was agoodly thing to behold, and Dilling felt a simple pride in it; and inthe evenings he sang songs for the benefit of Bet and the kindlyheathen in the kitchen.  He had arranged for the transportation ofthe wool with Papin, who was sending it on to Philadelphia thatyear.  So the supply wagon went back and forth between theEsmeralda Ranch and the Edge of Things, and the last time outCross-Eyed Kit went with it, with instructions to go on to thefoothills for provisions.</p><p>The next three weeks passed more quickly.  Dilling had doublework because Kit was away, and every other night he slept in theopen with the dogs beside the sheep.  Things appeared to bemoving, and he grew loquacious with elation, and wrotevoluminous letters which he intended to send to Letlow some time,using the leaves of his memorandum book for the purpose.  Almostevery day he made additions to another letter, &#8212; a very long one, &#8212;which he never intended to send to any one; but it was addressed toMiss Katherine Cusack.</p><pb id="page334" /><p>"I reckon yeh never heard what happened t' young Cusack, whowas here before yeh, sir?" asked Big Hank of Brown one morning,as they skirted the chaparral together, after driving back thestragglers.</p><p>"No, I don't know the particulars.  I heard he lost his health."</p><p>"Went off his nut, sir, &#8212; clean off.  It wuz queer, too, him havin'his sister with him, and enj'ying th' pleasures of society, s' t' speak. He worked pretty hard, I reckon, an' wuz out with th' sheep alonemost of th' time, &#8212; he wuz short-handed, same ez you, sir.  They sayhe got s' used t' keepin' his tongue in his head that he wouldn't speakeven when he got th' chanct.  Well, I'll be 'ternal damned if he didn'tdrop down 'long-side th' sheep, one day, an' take t' eatin' grass!  Hisman found him thar, eatin' it, when he come out t' take th' watch. He didn't know what t' do, an' he rode back hell f'r blazes to th'ranch, an' his sister, she got on her pony, an' streaked out, &#8212; it wasfive miles she had to go.  An' thar he was, a-eatin' grass!  She gotdown by him, an' called him, an' petted him, an' cried over him, an'all he said was, 'Baa! baa!'  One of th' men at th' Esmeralda tol' me."</p><p>"Great God!  And then what did his sister do?"</p><p>"She had him lifted in th' saddle, an' she walked an' held himthar, all the way to th' house.  Then she treated him fur fever, an'kep' coolin' things to his head.  She thought it might h' bin th' sun. But 'twere more 'n sun.  Then she took him in th' supply wagon backacross th' trail, her Chinee a-drivin', and they say she went up to herol' home in San Francisco.  Howsome that may be, th' railroadauthorities, they wouldn't let him in a passenger coach, an' she wentoff ridin' in th' baggage car, a-holdin' of his head an' comfortin' him. They said he never thanked her none.  He jus' said, 'Baa! baa!' an'cried 'cause they wouldn't let him out t' th' grass."</p><p>"But where are they now?"</p><p>"I hain't heard, sir."</p><p>"Why have you never told me this story before, Hank?"</p><p>"Well, Mr. Papin, he give it out col' <hi rend="italic">an'</hi> flat that youwa'n't to be tol'.  But yer so steady now, sir, I know it don't cut noice."</p><p>"No," said Brown, and he set spur to his pony and rode on.</p><p>But he was not able, either by day or by night, to banish thevision of the man who had dropped on all fours beside his sheepand given tongue with them.</p><p>Some time before Brown had tamed a pretty wether to run aboutthe doorstep, and he and Bet made great friends of it, feeding it andteasing it, and teaching it to curl up nights on a bed of hay in thecourt.  But now the little creature became offensive to him, and heresented its intimacy.  When it came to him, where he sat smokingbefore his door evenings, and rubbed its head against his leg, he hadtrouble to keep from an outbreak of anger.  In the grotesquetwilight, when the cacti looked like hob-goblins, and Bet's eyesgrew phosphorescent, and Lung crooned an awful song in a heathentongue, Brown got fanciful, and it seemed as if Dickie Bird &#8212; thelittle wether &#8212; were inviting him to drop down on all fours with himand say "baa," as any sociable creature ought to do, looking at thematter, of course, from Dickie Bird's point of view.  But, as a matterof fact, at this hour Dickie was on his bed, and only awoke to bleatnow and then, out of the perfect contentment of his &#8212; stomach. Brown roared over his twilight nonsense the next morning, whenthe sun got up.  The only trouble was that he came near laughing toolong.  It appeared as if, with a trifle of careless on the part ofBrown, the laugh might become the master.</p><p>"Kit got back with the supply wagon and a few letters, but therewas no word from Philadelphia among them.</p><p>"Pshaw!" said Dilling, "I'm no boy,<pb id="page335" />to be so impatient over my first earnings."</p><p>Several weeks more passed, while a sort of dullness settled downupon the ranch.  Even Bet seemed to think that things were not quiteworth while.  Then the mail came from Papin's, and with it a letterfrom Dilling's agent at Philadelphia.  He regretted to inform Mr.Brown that his consignment had reached Philadelphia at a timewhen wool was selling at bottom prices, owing to the extensiveintroduction of foreign product, and also that there had been anunfortunate delay in the placing of the wool, thus causingconsiderable expense for storage.  He had the honor, however, toremit to Mr. Brown the inclosed amount, as per check, and, in thehope of serving him on future occasions, to remain his very truly.</p><p>Dilling looked at the amount of the check, mentally deducted thesum he had paid for the freight, and then made a confidence to thewether, who was sweetly chewing at the doormat.</p><p>"Dickie Bird," said he, "I am exactly seventeen dollars andeighty-five cents out of pocket.  Figures are a great thing, DickieBird, and by studying them you may learn a great many thingswhich you would not learn if you did not study figures."</p><p>There was a good curry, that night, for supper, and some nativeclaret which Kit had brought back with him, but Dilling could onlymake a pretense of eating.  Moreover, he could not sleep except byfits, and then he awoke with a cold sweat breaking out over him, forhe saw a man falling down beside his sheep and eating grass.</p><p>He had a determined aversion to taking any one into hisconfidence.  Papin, of course, was in the same boat.  But Papin wasonly the manager of the Esmeralda, and he had a rich firm behindhim.  The fluctuations of trade did not greatly disturb the serenity ofhis soul, and they in no way detracted from the pleasure to bederived from a perusal of the Pages of Shakespeare of Stratford. But aunt Betty and Letlow should not know.  Besides, if AniceComstock found it out, she would lay it to his frivolity.  Snug,comfortable, unknowing lives they lived, those people back East!  Itwould do them good to get out of their oiled grooves, and find howthe world is made to move and how much pushing it takes to moveit.  The man at the Edge of Things was accumulating somebitterness.  He incidentally tore up the letter he had written toLetlow, and he did not write to aunt Betty.  But to the letter whichhe did not mean to send &#8212; which he never could send &#8212; he madepassionate additions, and the woman who did not know him, butwho knew so many of the sorrows that he knew, was made therecipient of all the secrets of his soul.  But the drawback to that wasthat she did not know it.</p><p>Papin said there was hope for better fortune in the spring, andDilling comforted himself with belief in this.  He had no intentionof weakening.  He had the responsibility of the investment, and hemeant to justify his judgment in his aunt's eyes.  Moreover, he couldthink of nothing else to which he could turn his hand.  So hestrengthened himself with the inscription on the wall, dailyaugmented the size of the letter which would never be sent, andwent about his tasks.</p><p>But all his resolution could not keep the dead heat of autumnfrom weighing on him like a curse, nor his eyes from aching at thedistance about him, the absolute vacuity of outreaching space.  Abrawl of street ruffians would have been a desired drama, since itwould have furnished a scene of action and an evidence of humanpassion.  Even Kit and Hank got to wearing on each other; but theywere old herders, and they knew the cause of their irritability, andso regarded it as impersonally as possible.  Then the mild andmeaningless winter<pb id="page336" />came on, the winter of the Southern plain, and the rains fell.  Themen lit fires at night to fight the damp.  Everything mildewed,cutlery, clothes, and books.  The sheep were sullen and obstinate,and there was nothing, as Dilling had said to Louis Papin a fewmonths before, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> time and sheep.</p><p>And in the midst of all this a genuine sorrow came to Brown. Aunt Betty passed beyond the knowledge of the world, &#8212; theknowledge which she had not held in high esteem, &#8212; to make suchdiscoveries as futurity holds.  Letlow wrote about it, and how AniceComstock and he had done all that Dilling would have done had hebeen there, and how Elder Urwin celebrated her virtues in anaddress three quarters of an hour long, and how she was laid withher fathers in the old cemetery.</p><p>"The beautiful old house is closed, and is waiting for you,"Letlow wrote.  "And Nettie bids me tell you that she will come backto care for it when you want her to do so.  Meantime, she is livingnear, and is keeping an eye upon dear aunt Betty's treasures.  Itgrieves me to say it, Dil, but you might have cheered her last daysmore than you did.  She was forever sending poor old Nettie to thepost office, and you know yourself how seldom she got what shewanted.  As for me, you never write to me now.  It is strange of you,Dil.  Of course, if you do not want to have anything more to do withme, you may go to the devil.  But I cannot think this is the case.  Donot try to live without your old friends.  They find it hard, believeme, to live without you."</p><p>After that, of course, poor Dilling wrote; and then to his othersorrows was added the pang of unavailing regret.  It is a pang whichalmost every one must know, but it was new to Dilling, and itroweled him like a sharp spur.  Dear aunt Betty!  Was it possibleshe could have thought him ungrateful?  He was only waiting towrite till he could justify himself in her eyes.  But she did not know,&#8212; she did not know.  She waited for the letters that did not come,and suspected &#8212; what?  In the loneliness of the rains, Dilling senthis soul in search for hers, praying for pardon.  But he had no senseof forgiveness.  The dead did not come back to comfort him.</p><p>By the time for the spring shearing his funds were almostexhausted, and he confided to his men that, unless he realizedsomething on his wool, the experiment might be considered afailure.</p><p>It was just before the day set for the shearing that the Mexicansmade their first raid on him and cut out two hundred sheep.  Theepisode was singularly tame.  It happened at night, and when BigHank was on duty.  The sheep were two miles to the south of thehouse, and the night was a clear and starlit one.  Hank was awakeand at his post, and he saw the whole thing, which was smallenough satisfaction.  He emptied the contents of his revolvers andhis rifle, and he had a dead horse to show that he had been in action,but none of the Mexican bullets hit him.  That was the onlyadventure of the year.</p><p>There was some profit from the wool that spring.  "Just enough,"Brown remarked to Papin, "to make me feel that it would be wrongto give up the business.  I'll stick it out, Mr. Papin.  I ought to beable to stand it, if you can."</p><p>"Why, there's some difference between your situation and mine,Brown.  You know I saw a little of life before I came.  I had myday.  It happened to end for me rather suddenly, you know &#8212; andthat's why I came."</p><p>"No," said the younger man, "I didn't know, Mr. Papin."</p><p>"So you see it doesn't make very much difference to me where Iam.  I suppose Paris would seem as lonesome as the free grasscountry, eh, Brown?"</p><p>"I don't know, sir.  I'd like to have an opportunity forcomparison."</p><p>And then Papin read to him the things<pb id="page337" />that Jacques said in the forest of Arden.</p><p>The summer came, hot as the mouth of the pit.  Nothinghappened.  Oh yes, Bet had puppies, and brought them in, one at atime, for Dilling to see, and he made a bed for them in his waste-paper basket.  And Cross-Eyed Kit had the fever, and Brown nursedhim through it, and hired another man to substitute.  When Kit gotwell, it was decided to keep the other man, and the bringing of anew personality into the company had a good effect, particularly asthe new man could sing.  Wool was looking up a little by fall, andBrown began once more to feel that there might be some return forthe investment.</p><p>All the poetry of the life had gone for him by this time.  He couldhave enjoyed adventure, he said to himself, even whenaccompanied by great hardship and danger, but this endless stretchof nothingness was as wearing as life in a mephitic dungeon.  Thewind of the morning could no longer elate him, nor the stars of thenight speak to his soul.  A nostalgia for his kind seized upon him,and he made up conversations, pretending that his chosen friendsparticipated in them with him.  One friend was there whom he hadnever seen, but he always gave her the best things to say; and whenthere was something peculiarly sensible and dull in the way of aremark, he accorded it to Anice Comstock.  Letlow said some gaythings, some irresistible things, and Brown roared over them; andthen the Chinaman peeped in at the door, shaking his old ivoryhead, and slipping away like a rat.  One day he ventured on someadvice in that peculiar English which he affected, &#8212; an Englishpicked up principally on the ranch, and converted into a liquescentlipogram.</p><p>"Mislie Blown," said he, as he served Dilling with some cannedsalmon, into which he had introduced a most un-christian quantityof red pepper, "loo go see Mislie Papin.  It good fo' loo."</p><p>"Think I need it, Lung?" asked Brown wistfully.</p><p>"Loo need it.  Go, Mislie Blown."  He nodded his head anincalculable number of times, and he did not grin.</p><p>"Lung," said Brown slowly, "I believe you are serious, &#8212; and Iam sure you are a kind creature.  I think I'll go at once.  You explainto the men," and, to Lung's unspeakable astonishment, he saddledon the minute and made off, Bet following.</p><p>So, that night, when the men rode up for supper, they found the"boss" off for a junket.</p><p>"It do him good," explained Lung.</p><p>Hank regarded his boots with a pensive expression.  Suddenly hebroke into a yell.</p><p>"Lung," he shouted, "you heathen, let's holler!  Whoop 'er up,Kit!  Dance, you devils!  Hi, dance to this!"  And he sang, in aterrible voice and a little off key, some words to a silly tune.</p><p>The Chinaman obeyed orders, &#8212; he was wise, and knew how toobey, &#8212; and now and then he broke into the song with a discordantcroak.</p><p>"I feel better," said Hank, decorating his remark in a mannerpeculiar to himself.  "It done me good.  I had to do it or bust.  I wishth' boss could h' bin in th' party."</p><p>"It done him good," supplemented Lung.</p><p>"It would, my friend, &#8212; it would.  Now make th' cakes."</p></div2><div2 type="chapter"><head>V.</head><p>The rain was over all the plain, and the night shut downdismally.  Dilling had been trailing all day toward the EsmeraldaRanch, but as the darkness began to fall he was seized with adistaste for his visit.  A sodden languor pervaded his soul.  Hemarveled that the day had gone so soon, and that he was not at theend of his journey.  But still,<pb id="page338" />what did it matter?  And why see Papin, anyway, &#8212; Papin, who hadthe "inextinguishable ennui," and who read Shakespeare and waitedfor time to roll by.  Papin had actually learned to let it roll bywithout taking any of the responsibility.  He had found out that ithad been rolling before he was born; that he was, personally, animmaterial accident; and that the rolling would keep on after theworms had banqueted upon him.  In short, Papin was toophilosophic, though a fine fellow.  Moreover, it was not to beforgotten that he had once performed a signal service for the listlesswanderer there in the rain.  He had told him the name of KatherineCusack, a thing which had done more to mitigate the womanlesssolitude at the Edge of Things than any other event.  If Papin hadreally known her well, it is not unlikely that Dilling would have hadsome motive for pushing on, but the subject was one which Papinhad exhausted long since.  So the pony was allowed to straggle atwill, and it was midnight when the ranch was reached.</p><p>Lights shone from the windows of Papin's rooms.</p><p>"He sits late," said the wanderer.  "He sits as late as I do. Perhaps for the same reason.  He sits late to converse with shadows,&#8212; with shadows!"  He shuddered a little, and dropped wearily fromhis pony.  As he walked toward the door, he involuntarily glanced inthrough the window.  Papin was not alone.  A young man sat withhim.  The two were in earnest conversation.  The cigars in theirfingers had gone out.  Dilling turned away sullenly.</p><p>"Papin is very well entertained," he said.  "He hasn't the leastneed of me.  It serves me right for coming.  I'll kick that fool Lungsome day."  But Bet announced her arrival vociferously, and Papinthrew open the door.</p><p>"By all that's mysterious," Brown heard him cry, "if here isn't hisdog now!"</p><p>Dilling slunk back from the window, and had an instinct to run. Something about the shape of the head of the other man who satwithin the room filled him with such a frantic longing, such atorment of memory of glad and foolish days, that he felt he couldnot speak to any one.  But Bet led the party of investigation, andPapin discovered Brown skulking, and dragged him in to the light,where he stood blinking and looking away from the other men, likea child overcome with shyness.  Papin and his companion, however,were using their eyes with purpose, and what they saw was acreature with haggard eyes and a drawn face.  About him hung hissoaking clothes, and his hair was long on his neck, and faded tosomething lighter than hay color by the sun of the desert.</p><p>"My soul!" half whispered Papin.  "You're not a ghost, are you,Brown?"</p><p>The man whom Brown had seen through the window had gonedeadly pale.  The clustering black curls stood damp upon hisforehead.  His comely face was twitching with nervousness.  Brownlaughed rather foolishly in reply to Papin's question, and the guestcame forward and put his arms about Brown's shoulders, and lookedhim in the face.  Then he hugged him very hard, and Browntrembled.  His eyes closed.  A few drops of saliva trickled from hismouth.</p><p>"Is he going to faint?" whispered the guest to Papin.</p><p>The ranchman got some brandy, and poured it down Brown'sthroat.  Then Dil found speech.</p><p>"I knew it was you, all the time, Tommy," he said, &#8212; "I knew itwas you, you darned dude!"</p><p>He sank beside the table and buried his face in his arms.  TomLetlow dropped beside him, threw an arm over his heavingshoulders, and waited.  Papin lit a cigar, picked up his tatteredShakespeare, and also waited.  After a time Brown looked up.</p><pb id="page339" /><p>"Don't lay it up against me," he pleaded.  "I know I'm an ass, butI've just emerged from" &#8212;</p><p>There was a very long silence.</p><p>"Well, from what, Dil?"</p><p>"From &#8212; I can hardly tell you what &#8212; from a place peopled withshadows &#8212; who talked.  I was afraid of you at first, because I couldnot tell whether you were one of the shadows or not."</p><p>"Close call," muttered Papin.  Letlow gritted his teeth.  Papinwent to the quarters to send a man to look after the horse, andLetlow took Brown into his chamber for dry clothing.  Half an hourlater, the three men sat down together more calmly in Papin'scomfortable sitting room.  Brown looked about him with a smile ofincredulity, something like that a man might wear who had just gotaccustomed to purgatorial flames, when he opened his eyes tobehold paradise.  Brown said something of the sort.</p><p>"I was getting used to it, you know, Tommy, &#8212; getting used tothe Robinson Crusoe business, and to having a sore-eyed wether formy especial confidant.  And now I suppose I'll be all upset again. But you will stay with me a little while, Tommy?  You'll do thatmuch for &#8212; for the advancement of the race, so to speak."  His oldtrick of raillery returned at the mere sight of Letlow, and with eachlight-hearted word that he spoke something tight and terrible withinhis brain seemed to loosen into comfort.</p><p>"No, I won't," replied Letlow emphatically.  "I don't want toknow any more than I do about what you've gone through, old man. I've come to take you away with me."</p><p>"Oh, I can't leave, Tommy; the sheep" &#8212;</p><p>"Damn the sheep!  Tell your men to divide the spoils anywaythey please.  Are you much in arrears?"</p><p>"Not at all, really; only for wages since last shearing, as iscustomary."</p><p>"Then let the men divide the spoils, as I said."</p><p>"I've told him the &#8212; situation, Mr. Brown.  I hope you don't thinkit a liberty," Papin interposed.</p><p>Brown smiled, and the smile had a hint of the glory of otherdays, when the general gorgeousness of that smile was celebrated ina class song at college.</p><p>"Mr. Papin is so good a friend," he said, "that he can sayanything he pleases about me.  He once did me a tremendousservice and never knew it.  Pretty much all the happiness I have hadsince I left home has been connected with the service he did forme."</p><p>"What are you talking about?" cried the man with the tatteredShakespeare.  His amazement was unfeigned.</p><p>"I said he didn't know," explained Brown.  "Oh, Tommy,Tommy, what a wonder to see you?  And your plans, &#8212; what arethey?"</p><p>"To get you away from here."</p><p>"But furthermore?"</p><p>"Well, as to myself, I've got a mission from my paper to go up tothe Klondike.  I may say I've caught on very well, Dil.  They like meall right, and I like the work.  I've done some things out of the usual,and it's attracted attention.  Excuse this infantile candor, but there'sno one else to tell you, so I must; for of course I insist on yourfinding it out.  I've contracted to go up to the Klondike, and afterthat I have a roving commission for an illustrated weekly, and I'm togo and see anything I like and tell what I think about it.  Likewise Iam to take pictures of it."</p><p>Brown's face spoke silent congratulations.</p><p>"Then I have an anchor to wind-ward.  At least, that may not bethe right metaphor, and, upon reflection, I don't think it is."  Hecolored distinctly.</p><p>"Call it a sweetheart, and let it go at that," suggested Papin.</p><p>"All right," assented Letlow, "why<pb id="page340" />not?  Call it a sweetheart, for argument's sake."</p><p>"It's Anice Comstock!" cried Brown, his intuitions sharpened byhis sufferings.  "She's a nice girl, Tommy.  I've thought of her agood deal at times, and of how her pretty summer gowns used torustle about the tennis court, and of how sensible she was."</p><p>"Oh, we didn't half know her that summer, Dil!  She was shy andnot used to such fools as we were.  So we couldn't bring out the bestin her.  But she's a lovely woman if ever there was one.  And she'sanxious about you, too, Dil, and so is Miss Pilsbury."</p><p>"That is kind of them both."</p><p>"You don't seem interested," Letlow said, smiling.</p><p>"I am very truly grateful, Tommy."  He thought of the bulkyletter in his pocket, which he did not mean to send, &#8212; which henever <hi rend="italic">could</hi> send, &#8212; and smiled.</p><p>"This may be a good time to tell you that within the last ninetydays it has transpired that aunt Betty was a richer woman than sheknew herself to be.  A lot of land to which she attached noimportance has come to have a value.  It's wanted for summer hotelsand cottages and such iniquity.  I have the proposals with me. That's a big part of my business here.  You can close all that up, goback to the old house, revel in its refinement, and marry any girlyou please &#8212; when you get your hair cut."</p><p>Brown sat and half drowsed over this suggestion.  His eyes werenarrowed like those of one accustomed to turning thought andspeech within.</p><p>"I'll go if Mr. Papin will go with me," he declared at last.</p><p>"But the ranchman shook his head.  "I have become wedded tomy solitude," he said.  "And I couldn't play tennis!"  He looked soforeign to this occupation that the young men shouted withmerriment.</p><p>Then Letlow went on.  "I stopped in San Francisco on the waydown, and fixed it up with a man there about the Klondike.  He toldme a volume.  He's acquainted with the country, &#8212; he's been overthe Skaguay once himself.  He has a store at Juneau, and takes thesupplies up there in his own vessel.  Now he's put a house up for hisfamily, and he's taking his wife and niece with him this trip.  I'vearranged conditionally for you too, Dil."</p><p>"I don't know that I have the appetite for adventure that I used tohave," said Brown sadly.  The Klondike did not appeal to him.  Hehad a vision of a solitude as complete as that of the sun-bakeddesert, and more unkind.  But then neither did the idea of returningto the East and the dull, formal old town appeal to him.  Heregarded his state of mind with disgust.  He appeared to be inert.  "Iwonder if my springs are all broken," he thought, "and if I shallnever go again."</p><p>"If it was for good and all," broke in Letlow, "I shouldn't careabout the Klondike myself.  But it's an experience, merely.  AfterI'm through with that I may go to Hawaii.  Things are looking up forus over there, you know.  Oh!  I'm out to see things now, Dil, andincidentally I want to find a way to make a fortune if I can.  And Ithink I can.  I can almost smell my ship a-coming in."  He sniffedthe air expectantly.  "Then I'll send back for Anice &#8212; or go back forher."</p><p>"She's a nice girl," admitted Brown, still unenthusiastically.  "Icongratulate you, Tommy.  How did you ever tame yourselfsufficiently to win the approval of such a modest, honest, starchy,altogether desirable sort of girl?  Everything will go just right whenyou have married her.  Your world will run on oiled groovesforevermore."</p><p>Letlow took a photograph out of his pocket and laid it on thetable.  "Look," he said with pride.</p><pb id="page341" /><p>Dilling beheld the goodly face of Anice Comstock.  "Mypowers," he cried, "what a little lady!  What a civilized Christiancreature!  I had forgotten that a woman could look like that.  You<hi rend="italic">are</hi> fortunate, Tommy!"</p><p>Papin came and looked over Brown's shoulder, and he sighed,and then swore softly &#8212; almost tenderly &#8212; under his breath.</p><p>"That's what we miss," said he.</p><p>"Doesn't that make you want to see Miss Pilsbury, Dil?  She issincerely concerned about you.  You've known her always, and youhave liked each other.  Once she thought you weren't seriousenough" &#8212;</p><p>"Ah!  She'd have changed her mind if she could have seen melately.  But no, Tommy, it doesn't make me want to see her,because" &#8212; He did not finish the sentence, but left it raw-edged.</p><p>Papin suddenly strode to the table and pounded it with his fist. "Brown," he exclaimed, "you look as if you had a secret!  Youhaven't got a sweetheart out there in the wilderness, have you?  Myheaven, Brown, if you've found a woman out there, you're" &#8212;  Papinstopped because his guest did not laugh at all.  On the contrary, hegrew solemn.  "I beg your pardon, Brown.  I have said somethingstupid?"</p><p>"No, indeed &#8212; something perspicacious.  I haven't found awoman out there, Mr. Papin, but &#8212; but I have found the soul of awoman."</p><p>The men stared and were uncomfortable.  Men do not likeconfidences as a general thing.</p><p>The rain beat down harder than ever, and they could hear itpouring off the roof; but in spite of that, there was a lightening inthe far east.  The dawn was coming over the desert.  No oneencouraged Dilling, but he had made up his mind to go on.  He drewthe great folio from his pocket, and slowly unwrapped the silkenoilcloth which enveloped it.</p><p>"I was afraid it would mildew," he explained.</p><p>"The soul of the woman, Dil?"</p><p>"No.  The letter I wrote to the woman.  I discovered traces of herout there in the solitude, in the silence, Tommy, &#8212; prehistorictraces, you may say.  It has been the study of these which has keptmy soul alive.  It has been what I learned from her that has made itpossible for me to endure what I have.  Mr. Papin understands.  Isaid, didn't I, that Mr. Papin had once done me a great service?  It istrue.  The service was inestimable.  He told me her name."</p><p>He pointed to the inscription on the outside of the package. Letlow stooped to read, and Papin peered over his shoulder.</p><p>"Katherine Cusack," half whispered Letlow, his eyes growingbig, "Kath &#8212;  Why, man of many marvels, that's the name ofCaptain Cusack's niece!  That's the girl who is going to Alaska onthe same boat with us!  That's the &#8212; the" &#8212;</p><p>"Oh, you're fooling, Tommy!  Please don't."  Brown spoke like ateased boy.</p><p>"Fooling?  I'm not such a donkey.  It's she, I tell you.  Thecaptain said she needed a change, that she had recently buried herbrother, and"  &#8212;</p><p>"Oh, the poor devil is dead!  Papin, you hear that?  The bleatingwretch is gone."</p><p>"Yes, he's dead.  His sister stayed with him till the last.  CaptainCusack told me all about it.  Then I came on, hot-footed, for you."</p><p>"But I say, Tommy, it can't be, you know.  There's somemistake."</p><p>"No mistake, Dil.  We'll close up your affairs here" &#8212;</p><p>"Oh, that's easy.  One of my men will take things off my handsfor me.  He's very trustworthy.  I'll let them run things till I comeback, share and share alike &#8212; Li Lung included.  He's<pb id="page342" />a good heathen.  He told me to come over here to-night.  I'll go backand pack."</p><p>He was thinking of the workbasket and the little glove, the clayjugs and the folding mirror.  He would need them for an argument.</p><p>"And then it's the Klondike, Tommy!  My uncle, there's the smellof adventure in it!  What route shall you take, &#8212; the Dyea, theChilcat?  But that doesn't matter.  Of course I may not go over thepass with you, eh?  I may go into business in &#8212; in Juneau.  As yousay" (though indeed the bewildered Letlow had said nothing of thesort), "it would be no place for me back in the old town.  Notwithout aunt Betty.  Why, I couldn't keep that boxwood trimmed, &#8212;now, could I, Tommy?  It's adventure I need.  The Klondike's justthe thing.  As for the East, it can get along without me very well,can't it, Papin?"</p><p>"Very well indeed," said Papin, who knew.</p><closer><signed rend="right"><hi rend="italic">Elia W.
