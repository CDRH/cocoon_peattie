FOREST</hi>: He is a man of fifty or sixty, tall, thin, gray, with a clean-shaven, pale face, and dark eyes that look out from under heavy brows, burning with a fanatical fervor. His voice varies between a natural, rather gentle, courteous, quiet, unpretentious way of speaking, to a deep, impressive tone of commanding oratory. He holds himself with a quiet dignity, and bows with deferential reserve in response to the remarks of his admirers. When he speaks of Harold and of his own work, he straightens, seems taller, and stares off into space, exultant. Throughout the play it is necessary for the character to catch the elusive hint of satisfaction that the Doctor feels in the role of comforter that he plays. One cannot call his air exactly smug, and yet, if he were not so grave, he would be smug.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. FOREST</hi>: She is a slim, quiet woman, about the Doctor's age, with a weary manner. She rouses herself to smile at praise of him, or to anxiously defend the slightest criticism or question of him; the rest of the time she sinks into a weary lassitude. She is gray and quietly dressed in some somber color.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">GRAFTON</hi>: The butler is a small, thin man, quiet white, with a seamed, smooth-shaven face, dressed in the conventional garb of the butler.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">MARGOT</hi>: She is an elderly lady, with faded blue eyes, gray hair that shows under her white cap, a dark dress with a long, full skirt, relieved with a white kerchief and cuffs. She seems feeble beyond her years, and piteously distressed when she is aroused from her s&#233;ance.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">PROFESSOR DEEMER</hi>: He is a square-jawed, dynamic man of forty-five, dressed in well-cut business clothes, wearing glasses on a dark cord. His movements are definite, and his whole air is that of a successful broker or business man, rather than that of a professor.</p><figure entity="ep.ss.0036.03"><figDesc></figDesc></figure><pb n="p5" />	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. GARDEN</hi>: She is a little, elderly lady, brightly dressed in a flowered cr&#234;pe, with a bright hat to match. She wears black velvet around her neck to hold her sagging chin. She is deliberately, intensely, and nervously young and alert. She turns quickly from one of the characters to the other, with nervous, bird-like movements.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">LADY BEATTIE</hi>: She is a slim, grave woman of forty, with a beautiful, sad face. She is dressed in mourning.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHEILA</hi>: She is a beautiful young girl of twenty with a tender, quiet manner, a gentle, motherly way about her most of the time, as though she had gained control of a deep sorrow, and had become the finer person for it. She is grave, self-contained, and thoroughly poised. Her detachment from the rest of the group at the opening of the play is very deliberate and intentional, and should be got over. She is dressed in a simple, becoming afternoon dress of dark blue or black.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">HAROLD FOREST</hi>: He is a haggard young man of twenty-five, dressed in a private's uniform. He moves slowly, as though he had been long ill, and his pale, haggard face is the face of a person recovering from serious sickness. His speech is rapid, broken, and rather casual, as though many things had meant too much to him for him to be very definite about them. He speaks often with a weary light in his eyes, and a half smile on his lips.</p></div1><div1><head type="sub">PROPERTIES</head>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">GRAFTON</hi>: A large silver tray, with letters.</p>	<p><hi rend="smallcaps">DR.

It's been most convincing, Dr. Forest. Most convincing. I came here filled with doubt. I leave, a convert.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">LADY BEATTIE</hi>. I've no words, Cousin John. No words. You've opened the gates of Heaven to me. If your dear Harold, whom we all mourned, still lives, still remembers, why, so does my boy. So do all the hosts of the departed.</p><figure entity="ep.ss.0036.06"><figDesc></figDesc></figure><pb n="p8" /><p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. GARDEN</hi>. Yes, we may go rejoicing from now on. What I've learned in this room during the past year has brought the sunshine flooding back into my life. I took off my mourning as you see, and I've resumed life as if there'd been no sense of loss.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">DEEMER</hi>. But, Dr. Forest&#8212;is it not&#8211;singular&#8211;that your medium brings messages from no one but your song&#8211;from no one but Captain Forest?</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. FOREST</hi>. Ah, you see, Professor Deemer, dear old Margot is so very new to all this sort of thing. At first she was quiet unwilling to try, but when she saw how desperately we wished her to, she consented. She has always been such a quiet body; shy, except with us. Harold was&#8211;I mean, is&#8211;the core of her heart.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">DR. FOREST</hi>. Yes&#8212;the core of her heart. When she goes questing into the unknown, her spirit speeds straight to Harold. She heeds no one else.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. FOREST</hi>. No one else. I said to her the other day that we mustn't be selfish. There were others who longed to hear from their friends&#8211;even as we long to hear from our boy, but she begged me not to ask any more of her.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">LADY BEATTIE</hi>. No, no, I don't suppose we should. It is enough that she has proved they are still living, all those we thought we had lost. Oh, that is quite enough. I say that over and over to myself. What if I have had no direct word from Dick&#8212;</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. FOREST</hi>. You have had indirect word from him several times, dear Lady Grisel. Several times Harold has referred to him in his writings.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">DEEMER</hi>. Sir, you have changed the whole outlook of humanity. You've slain despair.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">MRS. GARDEN</hi>. It isn't that what you have done is so unheard of, Dr. Forest.

There other investigators might have been deceived, mightn't they? With you, Dr. Forest, one of the foremost scientific men of the age&#8211;there can be no doubt.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">DEEMED</hi>.

What grieves you then, Sheila? Isn't she fortunate beyond any of us?</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHEILA</hi>. I hardly know how to say it, sir, but it's as if she weren't satisfied.

You can't deny that you had direct communication with him.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHEILA</hi>. Oh, my dear, you know what the message was&#8211;something about being happy and our not mourning for him! If Harold could have got word through to me, do you think he would have said that&#8211;merely that?</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">DR. FOREST</hi>.

Mr. 'Arold!</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">HAROLD</hi>. You see, they had picked me out of some unspeakable mess. Picked a dozen of us out.

By and by I began to remember, but I couldn't get my name. I tell you, I thought till I blubbered like a three-year-old. But it wouldn't come, and then, today, suddenly I knew. Dad, it was as if I'd stopped and picked a needle out of a haysack. Found it after looking for centuries. The needle was my name, and once I had it, it grew till it was as big as a sword. Yes, sir, it seemed to me like a sword that I was holding up to the sun. I couldn't stop to explain to the hospital people. Didn't want to explain.
