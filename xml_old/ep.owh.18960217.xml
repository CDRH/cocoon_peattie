<head type="main">A WORD WITH THE WOMEN</head>

	<p>Mrs. Mary E. Lease, the deep voiced fellow populist, is going to enter the ministry. She is to preach at a church at Wichita next Sunday. She says that her political speeches were never without the ethics of Christ, and that she believes that evil times have come upon us as the result of our moral deliquencies. She does not intend to leave the lecture field. Her first sermon is to be delivered for the purpose of helping to pay off a church debt.</p>

<milestone unit="smallbar"/>

	<p>As a lecturer Mrs. Lease seldom lost an opportunity to <sic corr="sneer">snear</sic> at the ineffectiveness of the modern religious system not to cast aspersions upon clergymen. It is quite true that her lectures contained the ethics of Christ. She always believed in unselfish sociology. She always advocated self-sacrifice, a distribution of superfluous wealth, a government that would result for the good of all. So it must be inferred from her violent opposition to the modern church methods, and to clergymen in general, that she is to be a new sort of clergyman. She probably means to deal in truths rather than theories. She will not so much worship God as arraign man. She will not concern herself so much with the devil as the capitalist, and her eloquence will be directed toward the referendum rather than predestination. All this may fill many a meeting house and excite the populace. The populace can stand a little excitement, for it is sluggish with melancholy. But it is to be feared that Mrs. Lease's ideas will bring a petty rather than a noble dissatisfaction; and that they will so concentrate attention upon this mundane ball that one will have no time to dream of heaven. It is rather hard to realize that Mrs. Lease believes in any sort of heaven save that created by the divine acts of a populist legislature and confirmed by a populist senate. Of course it may be otherwise. One is forever being surprised. Even Mr. Ingersoll hopes for heavenly joys.</p>

<milestone unit="smallbar"/>

	<p>One has to fear that it would be difficult to listen to Mrs. Lease and remember much about the creator&#8212;Mrs. Lease is so absorbing. But then, one might try. It is possible to sustain a double action on the brain. There are people who can spell New York with their lips at the same time they write Chicago with their pens. It isn't easy, but it can be done.</p>

<milestone unit="smallbar"/>

	<p>Mrs. Lease, personally&#8211;but after all, why should one talk of Mrs. Lease's personality.</p>
