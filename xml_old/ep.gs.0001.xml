<head>THE SHAPE OF FEAR</head>

<p>TIM O'CONNOR&#8212;who was descended from the O'Conors

with one N&#8212;started life as a poet and an enthusiast.  His mother

had designed him for the priesthood, and at the age of fifteen, most

of his verses had an ecclesiastical tinge, but, somehow or other, he

got into the newspaper business instead, and became a pessimistic

gentleman, with a literary style of great beauty and an income of

modest proportions.  He fell in with men who talked of art for art's

sake,&#8212;though what right they had to speak of art at all nobody

knew,&#8212;and little by little his view of life and love became more or

less profane. He met a woman who sucked his heart's blood, and he

knew it and made no 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.02.jpg" n="2"/>

protest; nay, to the great amusement of the fellows who talked of art

for art's sake, he went the length of marrying her. He could not in

decency explain that he had the traditions of fine gentlemen behind

him and so had to do as he did, because his friends might not have

understood. He laughed at the days when he had thought of the

priesthood, blushed when he ran across any of those tender and

exquisite old verses he had written in his youth, and became

addicted to absinthe and other less peculiar drinks, and to gaming a

little to escape a madness of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>.</p>

<p>As the years went by he avoided, with more and more scorn,

that part of the world which he denominated Philistine, and

consorted only with the fellows who flocked about Jim O'Malley's

saloon. He was pleased with solitude, or with these convivial wits,

and with not very much else beside.  Jim O'Malley was a sort of

Irish poem, set to inspiring measure.   He was, in fact, a Hibernian 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.03.jpg" n="3"/>

M&#230;cenas, who knew better than to put bad whiskey before a

man of talent, or tell a trite tale in the presence of a wit. The

recountal of his disquisitions on politics and other current matters

had enabled no less than three men to acquire national reputations;

and a number of wretches, having gone the way of men who talk of

art for art's sake, and dying in foreign lands, or hospitals, or

asylums, having no one else to be homesick for, had been homesick

for Jim O'Malley, and wept for the sound of his voice and the grasp

of his hearty hand.</p>

<p>When Tim O'Connor turned his back upon most of the things he

was born to and took up with the life which he consistently lived till

the unspeakable end, he was unable to get rid of certain

peculiarities. For example, in spite of all his debauchery, he

continued to look like the Beloved Apostle. Notwithstanding abject

friendships he wrote limpid and noble English. Purity seemed to

dog his heels, no matter how violently he attempted 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.04.jpg" n="4"/>

to escape from her. He was never so drunk that he was not an

exquisite, and even his creditors, who had become inured to his

deceptions, confessed it was a privilege to meet so perfect a

gentleman. The creature who held him in bondage, body and soul,

actually came to love him for his gentleness, and for some quality

which baffled her, and made her ache with a strange longing which

she could not define. Not that she ever defined anything, poor little

beast!  She had skin the color of pale gold, and yellow eyes with

brown lights in them, and great plaits of straw-colored hair. About

her lips was a fatal and sensuous smile, which, when it got hold of a

man's imagination, would not let it go, but held to it, and mocked it

till the day of his death.   She was the incarnation of the Eternal

Feminine, with all the wifeliness and the maternity left out&#8212;she

was ancient, yet ever young, and familiar as joy or tears or sin.</p>

<p>She took good care of Tim in some ways: 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.05.jpg" n="5"/>

fed him well, nursed him back to reason after a period of hard

drinking, saw that he put on overshoes when the walks were wet,

and looked after his money.   She even prized his brain, for she

discovered that it was a delicate little machine which produced

gold. By association with him and his friends, she learned that a

number of apparently useless things had value in the eyes of certain

convenient fools, and so she treasured the autographs of

distinguished persons who wrote to him&#8212;autographs which he

disdainfully tossed in the waste basket.   She was careful with

presentation copies from authors, and she went the length of urging

Tim to write a book himself. But at that he balked.</p>

<p>"Write a book!" he cried to her, his gentle face suddenly white

with passion. "Who am I to commit such a profanation?"</p>

<p>She didn't know what he meant, but she had a theory that it was

dangerous to excite him, and so she sat up till midnight to cook a

chop for him when he came home that night.</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.06.jpg" n="6"/>

<p>He preferred to have her sitting up for him, and he wanted every

electric light in their apartments turned to the full.   If, by any

chance, they returned together to a dark house, he would not enter

till she touched the button in the hall, and illuminated the room. Or 

if it so happened that the lights were turned off in the night time,

and he awoke to find himself in darkness, he shrieked till the

woman came running to his relief, and, with derisive laughter,

turned them on again. But when she found that after these frights he

lay trembling and white in his bed, she began to be alarmed for the

clever, gold-making little machine, and to renew her assiduities, and

to horde more tenaciously than ever, those valuable curios on which

she some day expected to realize when he was out of the way, and

no longer in a position to object to their barter.</p>

<p>O'Connor's idiosyncrasy of fear was a source of much

amusement among the boys at the office where he worked. They

made open sport of it, and yet, recognizing him 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.07.jpg" n="7"/>

for a sensitive plant, and granting that genius was entitled to

whimsicalities, it was their custom when they called for him after

work hours, to permit him to reach the lighted corridor before they

turned out the gas over his desk. This, they reasoned, was but a

slight service to perform for the most enchanting beggar in the

world.</p>

<p>"Dear fellow," said Rick Dodson, who loved him, "is it the

Devil you expect to see? And if so, why are you averse? Surely the

Devil is not such a bad old chap."</p>

<p>"You haven't found him so?"</p>

<p>"Tim, by heaven, you know, you ought to explain to me.  A

citizen of the world and a student of its purlieus, like myself, ought

to know what there is to know! Now you're a man of sense, in spite

of a few bad habits&#8212;such as myself, for example. Is this fad of

yours madness?&#8212;which would be quite to your credit,&#8212;for

gadzooks, I like a lunatic! Or is it the complaint of a man who has

gathered too much data on the subject of Old 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.08.jpg" n="8"/>

Rye? Or is it, as I suspect, something more occult, and therefore

more interesting?"</p>

<p>"Rick, boy," said Tim, "you're too&#8212;inquiring!" And he turned

to his desk with a look of delicate hauteur.</p>

<p>It was the very next night that these two tippling pessimists

spent together talking about certain disgruntled but immortal

gentlemen, who, having said their say and made the world quite

uncomfortable, had now journeyed on to inquire into the

nothingness which they postulated.  The dawn was breaking in the

muggy east; the bottles were empty, the cigars burnt out. Tim turned

toward his friend with a sharp breaking of sociable silence.</p>

<p>"Rick," he said, "do you know that Fear has a Shape?"</p>

<p>"And so has my nose!"</p>

<p>"You asked me the other night what I feared. Holy father, I

make my confession to you. What I fear is Fear."</p>

<p>"That's because you've drunk too much&#8212;or not enough.</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.09.jpg" n="9"/>

<lg>

       <l>"'Come, fill the cup, and in the fire of Spring</l>

         <l>Your winter garment of repentance fling&#8212;'"</l>

</lg>

<p>"My costume then would be too nebulous for this weather, dear

boy. But it's true what I was saying. I am afraid of ghosts."</p>

<p>"For an agnostic that seems a bit&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Agnostic! Yes, so completely an agnostic that I do not even

know that I do not know! God, man, do you mean you have no

ghosts&#8212;no&#8212;no things which shape themselves? Why, there are

things I have done&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Don't think of them, my boy!  See, 'night's candles are burnt

out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain top.'"</p>

<p>Tim looked about him with a sickly smile. He looked behind

him and there was nothing there; stared at the blank window, where

the smoky dawn showed its offensive face, and there was nothing

there.  He pushed away the moist hair from his haggard face&#8212;that

face which would look like the blessed St. John, and leaned heavily

back in his chair.</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.10.jpg" n="10"/>

<p>"'Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I,'" he murmured drowsily,

"'it is some meteor which the sun exhales, to be to thee this night

&#8212;'"</p>

<p>The words floated off in languid nothingness, and he slept.

Dodson arose preparatory to stretching himself on his couch. But

first he bent over his friend with a sense of tragic appreciation.</p>

<p>"Damned by the skin of his teeth!" he muttered.  "A little more,

and he would have gone right, and the Devil would have lost a good

fellow. As it is"&#8212;he smiled with his usual conceited delight in his

own sayings, even when they were uttered in soliloquy&#8212;"he is

merely one of those splendid gentlemen one will meet with in hell." 

Then Dodson had a momentary nostalgia for goodness himself, but

he soon overcame it, and stretching himself on his sofa, he, too,

slept.</p>

<p>That night he and O'Connor went together to hear "Faust" sung,

and returning to the office, Dodson prepared to write his criti- 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.11.jpg" n="11"/>

cism. Except for the distant clatter of telegraph instruments, or the

peremptory cries of "copy" from an upper room, the office was still.

Dodson wrote and smoked his interminable cigarettes; O' Connor

rested his head in his hands on the desk, and sat in perfect silence.

He did not know when Dodson finished, or when, arising, and

absent-mindedly extinguishing the lights, he moved to the door with

his copy in his hands.  Dodson gathered up the hats and coats as he

passed them where they lay on a chair, and called:</p>

<p>"It is done, Tim. Come, let's get out of this."</p>

<p>There was no answer, and he thought Tim was following, but

after he had handed his criticism to the city editor, he saw he was

still alone, and returned to the room for his friend. He advanced no

further than the doorway, for, as he stood in the dusky corridor and

looked within the darkened room, he saw before his friend a Shape,

white, of perfect loveliness, divinely delicate and pure 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.12.jpg" n="12"/>

and ethereal, which seemed as the embodiment of all goodness.

From it came a soft radiance and a perfume softer than the wind

when "it breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odor."

Staring at it, with eyes immovable, sat his friend.</p>

<p>It was strange that at sight of a thing so unspeakably fair, a

coldness like that which comes from the jewel-blue lips of a Muir

crevasse should have fallen upon Dodson, or that it was only by

summoning all the manhood that was left in him, that he was able to

restore light to the room, and to rush to his friend.  When he reached

poor Tim he was stone-still with paralysis.   They took him home to

the woman, who nursed him out of that attack&#8212;and later on

worried him into another.</p>

<p>When he was able to sit up and jeer at things a little again, and

help himself to the quail the woman broiled for him, Dodson, sitting

beside him, said:</p>

<p>"Did you call that little exhibition of yours 

<pb id="ep.gs.0001.13.jpg" n="13"/>

legerdemain, Tim, you sweep? Or are you really the Devil's

bairn?"</p>

<p>"It was the Shape of Fear," said Tim, quite seriously.</p>

<p>"But it seemed mild as mother's milk."</p>

<p>"It was compounded of the good I might have done. It is that

which I fear."</p>

<p>He would explain no more. Later&#8212;many months later&#8212;he

died patiently and sweetly in the madhouse, praying for rest. The

little beast with the yellow eyes had high mass celebrated for him,

which, all things considered, was almost as pathetic as it was

amusing.</p>

<p>Dodson was in Vienna when he heard of it.</p>

<p>"Sa, sa!" cried he. "I wish it wasn't so dark in the tomb! What

do you suppose Tim is looking at?"</p>

<p>As for Jim O'Malley, he was with difficulty kept from

illuminating the grave with electricity.</p>
