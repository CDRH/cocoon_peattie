	<p>Have you got a boy or a girl in your house? Is there any one there to make a noise, or teach you to forget your troubles, or to remind you how it used to be with you when you were young yourself? If not, would you like to have it so&#8211;in short, do you want a boy or a girl?</p>

	<p>Because if you do you can get one by going to Mrs. Cummings, the matron at the city jail, or to Mr. J.B. Jardine, or to Dr. Agnes Swetand. These persons are the committee representing the Children's Aid society. This association used to be known as the Boys and Girls' home, but since its reorganization under the superintendence of Mr. Hoagland it has been a branch of the State Children's Aid society. Mr. Cadet Taylor is the president of the local board. Rev. A.W. Clark has done a large part of the work&#8211;as he does, indeed, in all such enterprises in this city. And he now has on hand&#8211;to use the phraseology of the merchants&#8211;a choice collection of boys and girls. They need homes. They want fathers and mothers. And if there are any extra fathers and mothers they should apply at once.</p>

	<p>There's Johnny Stone&#8211;there's five years' of experience on his little head. And he has a brother who is but 16 months old. These little folks need one of the extra mothers terribly. And it would be a merciful thing if they could both be put in the same house. For they love each other.</p>

	<p>Talk about love, though! If you come to love, there's Marry Leswick and her brother, Willie Leswick. They were left unprotected by a trick of fate not long ago, and Willie, who is 6 years of age, was put in the Christian home at Council Bluffs, Mary, who is 10, was placed in the Old Woman's home at Omaha. The children fretted and pined, but no one knew just how to contrive to get them together again. So they settled it themselves. Willie started out to find his sister. He knew the name of the institution where she was placed. He showed the faithfulness of a dog and the instinct of a cat. He followed the car line out of Council Bluffs, running along breathlessly and hiding when anyone approached, lest he should be detected for a culprit and taken back the Home&#8211;the Home which was not home without his sister. And he reached Omaha, asking questions constantly until he found her and was clasped in her little arms. These children also want one of the extra mothers, and they must have only one mother between them. That is a settled thing&#8211;isn't it?</p>

	<p>Then there is a lonely little girl 7 years old who most sadly needs a home. Life has gone hard with her. She has already known sorrow. Some pitiful extra mother could find a grateful little heart in her. There is Willie Babbington, 12 years of age, who is also in search of a home, and Guy Ball, aged 11. There is one tiny girl only 2 years of age, who wants some one to braid her hair, kiss her good night and dress her doll and warm up her poor little life. And there is a girl of 15 also.</p>

	<p>Will any of the extra fathers or mothers offer themselves?</p>

	<p>Matron Cunnings at the jail will give all the necessary information and has authority to make out regular papers of adoption, the children having been legally released to her.</p>
