Peattie</byline><note type="editorial">AUTHOR OF "THE BELEAGUERED FOREST," THE SHAPE OF FEAR," ETC.</note><p>I HAVE a friend who has often said to me that she cared nothing forallegories, parables or symbols.</p><p>"I want the truth," she declared.  "I live by the truth.  Nothingless will do for me."</p><p>My friend was sitting in her home one day not long ago, whenthere came a ringing at her bell; and, as her one servant was awayfor the afternoon, she herself answered the door.  Without stood anold man with kind eyes and a cruel mouth &#8212; a very old man, greatlywrinkled, and with a huge pack on his back.</p><p>"I was sent here by a neighbor," he said, "who told me that Ihad just the sort of wares for which you cared the most.  She saidshe thought I would find you a generous purchaser."</p><p>There was a curious accent in the old man's speech which myfriend could not quite place.  It was at once familiar and unfamiliar,and she could not tell whether she liked or disliked it.  But she badehim enter, for he was old, and, besides, she thought he might,indeed, have something that she wished to buy.</p><p>"My wares," he said, "are very ancient.  It would be difficult tofind anything more antique."</p><p>"Then I hope they are beautiful," cried my friend, "for I haveno use for ugly things, no matter what their history may be.  It isonly beauty that can reconcile me to mold and tarnish anddustiness."</p><p>"Some are beautiful and some are grotesque," he said.  "But Iperceive by looking about your rooms that you have a fancy for thegrotesque as well as the beautiful."</p><p>"One is the face, the other the obverse of the coin," said myfriend.  "But pray show me your wares."</p><p>So from his pack the old man with the kind eyes and the cruelmouth took many packages, wrapped and tied with the cunning ofthe old races.</p><p>"I am a Merchant of Truth," he declared proudly, "and theseare my wares.  If you will permit me I will show you the contents ofthis one, which tells the truth about your home."</p><p>"Oh," sighed the woman eagerly, "if you please!"</p><p>When he had undone the curious wrappings, the old man tookforth a shining sphere of crystal, and held it before the woman sothat she saw a thing which the old man described in this wise:</p><p>"Your home," he said, "is a badly built little house, standing ina third-rate suburb of an ill-ordered city.  It is much too expensivefor the amount of comfort it gives, and even so, it is not reallyyours.  It is mortgaged, and you must pay interest as well as taxes. It is never as clean as it should be, by reason of the mills andfactories near at hand.  There is much incongruity in the furnishingand decoration of the rooms, and in winter some of these rooms arechilly and damp.  In summer you have no garden to which to retire. It is, you perceive, a poor place."</p><p>"Oh," cried the woman, "how mistaken you are!  I see truly,the things of which you speak, but do you not appreciate that here isthe door at which I bid my friends welcome?  And within is my fire,burning sweetly on the hearth.  There is my bed where I sleep sodeliciously, there the dear window at which the dawn looks <pb id="page87" />in.  Here is my kitchen where I cook the food by which we live, andhere is the table at which we eat it, with talk and laughter, and even,when we are so disposed, with song.  Everything in this housebelongs to me.  My husband bought these things and gave them tome &#8212; except such as are the gifts of friends.  I can walk about therooms and put my hands on this and on that and tell you the mostbeautiful stories imaginable about the friends who gave me thesethings.  It is curious, but I know of no one who has such friends as I. Really, this place, which looks so poor as reflected in that sphereand in your words, stands to me for home &#8212; home &#8212; home!"  Shesighed with happiness.</p><p>The cruelty deepened about the old man's mouth and thekindness glowed in his eyes.</p><p>"You mean," he said, "that this common place is a Symbol ofHome.  In this respect, I perceive it is not Truth which you desire,but the Symbol.  It is the possession of that which makes youcontent.  But come, perhaps I have something more to your liking. Here, madam, is the portrait of your husband as he is."  And heundid another wrapping and held up another sphere.</p><p>There she saw shadowed forth the figure of a man &#8212; a mansmall of stature, inefficient in his actions, petulant, narrow,affectionate, fairly honest, rather discouraged; a man with no strongpassions, no deep or original thoughts, no brave sins, no capacity forgreat sacrifices.  Yet one going faithfully his quiet way, returningalways to his home at night, and, in his pallid fashion loving hiswife, though often forgetting to tell her so by word or look.</p><p>"You see!" cried the Merchant of Truth.  "This is a veryrevealing little trinket.  It will, if looked at often enough, liberateyou from that domestic servitude which you now endure withmaudlin patience.  Will you buy it?"</p><p>"No, indeed!" cried the woman indignantly.  "That man is theonly one who ever kissed me on the lips.  I remember well the firsttime he did so.  It was at sunset, in a beautiful grove.  The goldenlight fell down between the tree trunks, making them black.  I feltall the beauty of the world throbbing through me and Icomprehended how incomplete it would be without love, and how Iwas blessed.  A wonderful vision came to me and I knew what lifeand work meant, so I put my hand in the man's, and always he and Ihave kept together.  And now we have a son and are a part of thefuture.  Oh, you have no idea what this man stands for to me!"</p><p>The old man smiled significantly.</p><p>"He also is a Symbol, I see," he said with contempt.  "It is notwhat he is that makes him dear.  It is, as you say, what he stands for. It is because you wish to be arrayed with the lovers, because youmust feel the wifeliness in you, because he gives you an excuse foryour feminine sacrifices, that you cherish him.  He is the Symbol ofnoble and protecting love &#8212; no more."</p><p>Then he revealed to her &#8212; somewhat doubtingly, for he wasbeginning to see that he should not find in her a ready purchaser &#8212; alittle wondrous iridescent sphere.</p><p>"Here," he said, "is the Truth about your son."</p><p>Now, so curious a thing was this, that even the sphere of Truthhad been affected by dreams, and it was some time before theirbeautiful prisms dispersed and showed her the pitiful facts &#8212; a littlespindling child, petulant like his father, narrow of brow, with a facein which selfishness and affection ever kept war.  The woman spokein great anger:</p><p>"I have a mind to show you the door," she said.  "Do you notknow that is my little child?  He is bone of my bone and flesh of myflesh, and sweeter to me than the night or the day.  Why, when his<pb id="page88" />little hands tug at my skirt and I feel myself his prisoner, I wouldnot change my service for all the freedom in the world.  When Ihear him cry out in the night, I am filled with poignant joy, and atmorning when his bare feet come pattering down to my room I givethanks for the day that brings me this delight.  It is true he is not sobright as some children, and that he is fretful and often ill, but, afterall, he is the core of life to me."</p><p>"He is a Symbol," said the old man in terrible accents.  "It isnot what he is but what he stands for that makes him so unutterablydear.  Any other child would do as well to quench the mother-thirst."</p><p>The woman was about to make a passionate disclaimer, but theold man took a dark and fateful glass from his pack and held it upbefore her.</p><p>Here, from tenebrous confusion the woman presently sawemerging a certain sad, historic Shape, and her heart contracted withsorrowful love.  A strange white passion shook her.  Upon this glassappeared curious writings, and though they were in tongues bothknown and unknown to the woman, she could in that hour, readthem all.  And now she wept:</p><p>"No, no," she sobbed; "you shall not take from me this Faith. It reconciles me to every sorrow.  It keeps me from being afraid. These writings say that my belief is discredited by history, rejectedby science, belied by human experience.  But what has it done forthe world &#8212; this Faith?  All of compassion and patience and hopethat we know is inspired by it.  Does not that give it authorityenough?  Oh, see, old man, if we lose this, we are adrift on a darksea, rudderless, and may as well cast ourselves at once into thewaves.  I assure you, you can have no notion of what this Faithmeans to the world &#8212; and to me!"</p><p>"I know what it means," said the old man in taunting accents. "It means a symbol.  It is, I confess, the Symbol of purity and loveby which a good half of the world lives.  It is very seldom I sell oneof these spheres, illuminating as they are."  And he looked withregret at the murky glass which began to cloud again until theetiolated figure on the instrument of shame, standing among lowblue hills, was obscured in shadows.</p><p>There was silence for a few moments, and then the man drewforth another glass.</p><p>"This is quite a modern affair," he said briskly, "and I dare say,being a woman of intelligence, you will feel a strong interest in it. Here is the Truth about your country.  At first it is a trifle confusing,but if you will be good enough to concentrate your attention on it,madam, you will soon see the details of the picture.  Behold thegreedy, ignorant mob which rules your land!  Observe the misrule,the selfishness, the subjugation of every ideal to the mad desire forwealth.  Note how seldom disinterestedness plays any part, how fewstatesmen you have, how a base machine dominates citizens andofficers."</p><p>"Oh, these are ephemeral conditions," protested the woman. "To-morrow they will be forgotten.  My country, how I love it!  Ithas often been a pain to me that I could not die for it.  I weep whenI hear the national airs, remembering how little I can do to serve theland of my birth and my devotion.  What liberty, what happiness doI enjoy here!  I love to think of it as the asylum for the unfortunate,and my heart expands when I reflect on all it means to me."</p><p>"Ah!" sneered the man.  "It is also a Symbol.  The country inwhich you delight exists only in your heart and in the hearts ofothers.  What you desire to die for is not the country as it is, but thecountry as you symbolize it.  Really, madam, I am muchdisappointed.  I see your friend misled me when she said you were alover of Truth.  But here are some things of quite a differentcharacter<pb id="page89" />which you may enjoy.  They are merely a lot of plays which I got ata great discount and will sell to you at a proportionate reduction. The beauty of them is, that instead of being written out they areshadowed in these large and shining spheres.  In one of these youmay see a whole drama enacted before your eyes.  If you willpermit me, I will arrange them upon this table."</p><p>Now indeed the woman was delighted, and for an hour the twosat in silence, watching, till at length the woman was able to makeher choice.  She thought she had now compensated the Merchant forall disappointments by making these purchases, but when he sawwhat her selections were, he was greatly irritated.</p><p>"You haven't a thing there that I wished you to have," hecomplained.  "The plays you have chosen were not selected by me,but were thrust upon me by the exigencies of the sale of which Ispoke to you.  You have passed by all the true stories of men andwomen, all the probable and understandable things, and taken thosefoolish old stories of 'Faust,' of 'Tannh&#228;user,' of 'Hamlet,''Everyman,' and 'The Sunken Bell.'  You have even one play whichhas not classicism to recommend it, the most inartistic thingStevenson ever wrote, 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.'"</p><p>"I have seen almost every play put upon the stage in my time,"said the woman.  "For the play is my one extravagance.  And Irealize now for the first time that the dramas of the realists havebeen quite forgotten by me.  They are all run together in a curiousconfusion, and I can not so much as remember the names of thecharacters.  It is, after all, only these Symbols that interest me andfind a place in my memory &#8212; it is these on which I think when I liewakeful in bed, these that sustain me in right-doing and keep mefaithful to the things that are eternal."</p><p>"I am done with you, madam!" shouted the man.  "Yet, no,upon reflection, not quite done.  For your disregard of the value ofmy wares you shall be properly punished.  Behold, here is the Truthabout yourself!"</p><p>And he held up to view another sphere.  The woman lookedlong and the color came and went in her face.  Her little handsclasped and unclasped, and once she would have fallen had not theold man supported her.  But after a time she pushed the sphereaway.</p><p>"There is a mistake somewhere," she said, in a voice at oncejoyous and humble.  "All of these things are true, I know, yet,somehow, that is not I.  There is something within me, not seen byany one, not understood by myself, which makes me different fromthat.  It is the thing that causes me to be careful of my life, whichleads me to believe that I shall live again and which lets me walkamong my fellows with my head held high.  It is the innermost self,the secret and eternal Me."</p><p>"It is a figment of your brain," scoffed the old man, "a piece oflegerdemain of the psychologists, a ghost conjured up by thechurchmen!"  He was trembling with anger, yet his eyes betrayed adefeat.  "Come," he cried, "confess!"</p><p>"I can confess nothing sir, except that as soon as you are gone Ishall comfort myself for all the Truth you have shown me, with mysweet Symbols.  I did not know till now that I lived by them.  Butnow that I know it I am all the more protected against sorrow andsin and falsehood.  I am only a poor woman and ignorant, yet this Iknow, that in my Symbols hides a greater truth than your Truthknows.  Farewell, sir, and come this way no more."</p></div1></body></text></TEI>
