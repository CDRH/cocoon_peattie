<head>ON THE NORTHERN ICE</head>

<p>THE winter nights up at Sault Ste. Marie are as white and

luminous as the Milky Way. The silence which rests upon the

solitude appears to be white also. Even sound has been included in

Nature's arrestment, for, indeed, save the still white frost, all things

seem to be obliterated. The stars have a poignant brightness, but

they belong to heaven and not to earth, and between their

immeasurable height and the still ice rolls the ebon ether in vast,

liquid billows.</p>

<p>In such a place it is difficult to believe that the world is actually

peopled. It seems as if it might be the dark of the day after Cain

killed Abel, and as if all of humanity's remainder was huddled in

affright away from the awful spaciousness of Creation.</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.02.jpg" n="18"/>

<p>The night Ralph Hagadorn started out for Echo Bay&#8212;bent on a

pleasant duty&#8212;he laughed to himself, and said that he did not at all

object to being the only man in the world, so long as the world

remained as unspeakably beautiful as it was when he buckled on his

skates and shot away into the solitude. He was bent on reaching his

best friend in time to act as groomsman, and business had delayed

him till time was at its briefest. So he journeyed by night and

journeyed alone, and when the tang of the frost got at his blood, he

felt as a spirited horse feels when it gets free of bit and bridle. The

ice was as glass, his skates were keen, his frame fit, and his venture

to his taste! So he laughed, and cut through the air as a sharp stone

cleaves the water.   He could hear the whistling of the air as he cleft

it.</p>

<p>As he went on and on in the black stillness, he began to have

fancies. He imagined himself enormously tall&#8212;a great Viking of

the Northland, hastening over icy fiords to his love. 

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.03.jpg" n="19"/>

And that reminded him that he had a love&#8212;though, indeed, that

thought was always present with him as a background for other

thoughts. To be sure, he had not told her that she was his love, for

he had seen her only a few times, and the auspicious occasion had

not yet presented itself. She lived at Echo Bay also, and was to be

the maid of honor to his friend's bride&#8212;which was one more reason

why he skated almost as swiftly as the wind, and why, now and

then, he let out a shout of exultation.</p>

<p>The one cloud that crossed Hagadorn's sun of expectancy was

the knowledge that Marie Beaujeu's father had money, and that

Marie lived in a house with two stories to it, and wore otter skin

about her throat and little satin-lined mink boots on her feet when

she went sledding.  Moreover, in the locket in which she treasured a

bit of her dead mother's hair, there was a black pearl as big as a pea.

These things made it difficult&#8212;perhaps impossible&#8212;for Ralph

Hagadorn to say more 

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.04.jpg" n="20"/>

than, "I love you." But that much he meant to say though he were

scourged with chagrin for his temerity.</p>

<p>This determination grew upon him as he swept along the ice

under the starlight. Venus made a glowing path toward the west and

seemed eager to reassure him. He was sorry he could not skim down

that avenue of light which flowed from the love-star, but he was

forced to turn his back upon it and face the black northeast.</p>

<p>It came to him with a shock that he was not alone.   His

eyelashes were frosted and his eyeballs blurred with the cold, so at

first he thought it might be an illusion. But when he had rubbed his

eyes hard, he made sure that not very far in front of him was a long

white skater in fluttering garments who sped over the ice as fast as

ever werewolf went.</p>

<p>He called aloud, but there was no answer. He shaped his hands

and trumpeted through them, but the silence was as before&#8212;it was

complete. So then he gave chase, setting his 

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.05.jpg" n="21"/>

teeth hard and putting a tension on his firm young muscles.  But go

however he would, the white skater went faster. After a time, as he

glanced at the cold gleam of the north star, he perceived that he was

being led from his direct path. For a moment he hesitated,

wondering if he would not better keep to his road, but his weird

companion seemed to draw him on irresistibly, and finding it sweet

to follow, he followed.</p>

<p>Of course it came to him more than once in that strange pursuit,

that the white skater was no earthly guide. Up in those latitudes men

see curious things when the hoar frost is on the earth. Hagadorn's

own father&#8212;to hark no further than that for an instance!&#8212;who

lived up there with the Lake Superior Indians, and worked in the

copper mines, had welcomed a woman at his hut one bitter night,

who was gone by morning, leaving wolf tracks on the snow! Yes, it

was so, and John Fontanelle, the half-breed, could tell you about it

any day&#8212;if he were alive. (Alack, 

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.06.jpg" n="22"/>

the snow where the wolf tracks were, is melted now!)</p>

<p>Well, Hagadorn followed the white skater all the night, and

when the ice flushed pink at dawn, and arrows of lovely light shot

up into the cold heavens, she was gone, and Hagadorn was at his

destination. The sun climbed arrogantly up to his place above all

other things, and as Hagadorn took off his skates and glanced

carelessly lakeward, he beheld a great wind-rift in the ice, and the

waves showing blue and hungry between white fields. Had he

rushed along his intended path, watching the stars to guide him, his

glance turned upward, all his body at magnificent momentum, he

must certainly have gone into that cold grave.</p>

<p>How wonderful that it had been sweet to follow the white

skater, and that he followed!</p>

<p>His heart beat hard as he hurried to his friend's house. But he

encountered no wedding furore.   His friend met him as men meet in

houses of mourning.</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.07.jpg" n="23"/>

<p>"Is this your wedding face?" cried Hagadorn. "Why, man,

starved as I am, I look more like a bridegroom than you!"</p>

<p>"There's no wedding to-day!"</p>

<p>"No wedding! Why, you're not&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Marie Beaujeu died last night&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Marie&#8212;"</p>

<p>"Died last night.   She had been skating in the afternoon, and

she came home chilled and wandering in her mind, as if the frost

had got in it somehow. She grew worse and worse, and all the time

she talked of you."</p>

<p>"Of me?"</p>

<p>"We wondered what it meant. No one knew you were

lovers."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it myself; more's the pity. At least, I didn't know

&#8212;"</p>

<p>"She said you were on the ice, and that you didn't know about

the big breaking-up, and she cried to us that the wind was off shore

and the rift widening. She cried over and over again that you could

come in by the old French creek if you only knew&#8212;"</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.08.jpg" n="24"/>

<p>"I came in that way."</p>

<p>"But how did you come to do that? It's out of the path. We

thought perhaps&#8212;"</p>

<p>But Hagadorn broke in with his story and told him all as it had

come to pass.</p>

<p>That day they watched beside the maiden, who lay with tapers

at her head and at her feet, and in the little church the bride who

might have been at her wedding said prayers for her friend. They

buried Marie Beaujeu in her bridesmaid white, and Hagadorn was

before the altar with her, as he had intended from the first! Then at

midnight the lovers who were to wed whispered their vows in the

gloom of the cold church, and walked together through the snow to

lay their bridal wreaths upon a grave.</p>

<p>Three nights later, Hagadorn skated back again to his home.

They wanted him to go by sunlight, but he had his way, and went

when Venus made her bright path on the ice.</p>

<p>The truth was, he had hoped for the companionship of the white

skater. But he did 

<pb id="ep.gs.0002.09.jpg" n="25"/>

not have it. His only companion was the wind. The only voice he

heard was the baying of a wolf on the north shore.  The world was

as empty and as white as if God had just created it, and the sun had

not yet colored nor man defiled it.</p>
