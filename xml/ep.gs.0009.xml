<head>STORY OF THE VANISHING PATIENT</head>

<p>THERE had always been strange stories about the house, but it

was a sensible, comfortable sort of a neighborhood, and people took

pains to say to one another that there was nothing in these tales&#8212;of

course not! Absolutely nothing! How could there be? It was a

matter of common remark, however, that considering the amount of

money the Nethertons had spent on the place, it was curious they

lived there so little. They were nearly always away,&#8212;up North in

the summer and down South in the winter, and over to Paris or

London now and then,&#8212;and when they did come home it was only

to entertain a number of guests from the city. The place was either

plunged in gloom or gayety. The 

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.02.jpg" n="104"/>

old gardener who kept house by himself in the cottage at the back of

the yard had things much his own way by far the greater part of the

time.</p>

<p>Dr. Block and his wife lived next door to the Nethertons, and he

and his wife, who were so absurd as to be very happy in each other's

company, had the benefit of the beautiful yard. They walked there

mornings when the leaves were silvered with dew; and evenings

they sat beside the lily pond and listened for the whip-poor-will.  

The doctor's wife moved her room over to that side of the house

which commanded a view of the yard, and thus made the

honeysuckles and laurel and clematis and all the masses of tossing

greenery her own. Sitting there day after day with her sewing, she

speculated about the mystery which hung impalpably yet

undeniably over the house.</p>

<p>It happened one night when she and her husband had gone to

their room, and were congratulating themselves on the fact that he 

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.03.jpg" n="105"/>

had no very sick patients and was likely to enjoy a good night's rest,

that a ring came at the door.</p>

<p>"If it's any one wanting you to leave home," warned his wife,

"you must tell them you are all worn out. You've been disturbed

every night this week, and it's too much!"</p>

<p>The young physician went downstairs. At the door stood a man

whom he had never seen before.</p>

<p>"My wife is lying very ill next door," said the stranger, "so ill

that I fear she will not live till morning. Will you please come to her

at once?"</p>

<p>"Next door?" cried the physician.  "I didn't know the Nethertons

were home!"</p>

<p>"Please hasten," begged the man. "I must go back to her. Follow

as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>The doctor went back upstairs to complete his toilet.</p>

<p>"How absurd," protested his wife when she heard the story.

"There is no one at the 

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.04.jpg" n="106"/>

Nethertons'. I sit where I can see the front door, and no one can

enter without my knowing it, and I have been sewing by the window

all day. If there were any one in the house, the gardener would have

the porch lantern lighted. It is some plot. Some one has designs on

you. You must not go."</p>

<p>But he went. As he left the room his wife placed a revolver in

his pocket.</p>

<p>The great porch of the mansion was dark, but the physician

made out that the door was open, and he entered. A feeble light

came from the bronze lamp at the turn of the stairs, and by it he

found his way, his feet sinking noiselessly in the rich carpets. At the

head of the stairs the man met him. The doctor thought himself a

tall man, but the stranger topped him by half a head.  He motioned

the physician to follow him, and the two went down the hall to the

front room. The place was flushed with a rose-colored glow from

several lamps. On a silken couch, in the midst of pillows, lay a

woman dying with 

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.05.jpg" n="107"/>

consumption.  She was like a lily, white, shapely, graceful, with

feeble yet charming movements. She looked at the doctor

appealingly; then, seeing in his eyes the involuntary verdict that her

hour was at hand, she turned toward her companion with a glance of

anguish. Dr. Block asked a few questions.   The man answered

them, the woman remaining silent. The physician administered

something stimulating, and then wrote a prescription which he

placed on the mantel-shelf.</p>

<p>"The drug store is closed to-night," he said, "and I fear the

druggist has gone home. You can have the prescription filled the

first thing in the morning, and I will be over before breakfast."</p>

<p>After that, there was no reason why he should not have gone

home.   Yet, oddly enough, he preferred to stay. Nor was it

professional anxiety that prompted this delay. He longed to watch

those mysterious persons, who, almost oblivious of his presence, 

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.06.jpg" n="108"/>

were speaking their mortal farewells in their glances, which were

impassioned and of unutterable sadness.</p>

<p>He sat as if fascinated.  He watched the glitter of rings on the

woman's long, white hands; he noted the waving of light hair about

her temples; he observed the details of her gown of soft white silk

which fell about her in voluminous folds. Now and then the man

gave her of the stimulant which the doctor had provided; sometimes

he bathed her face with water. Once he paced the floor for a

moment till a motion of her hand quieted him.</p>

<p>After a time, feeling that it would be more sensible and

considerate of him to leave, the doctor made his way home.   His

wife was awake, impatient to hear of his experiences. She listened

to his tale in silence, and when he had finished she turned her face

to the wall and made no comment.</p>

<p>"You seem to be ill, my dear," he said. "You have a chill. You

are shivering."</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.07.jpg" n="109"/>

<p>"I have no chill," she replied sharply. "But I&#8212;well, you may

leave the light burning."</p>

<p>The next morning before breakfast the doctor crossed the dewy

sward to the Netherton house.  The front door was locked, and no

one answered to his repeated ringings. The old gardener chanced to

be cutting the grass near at hand, and he came running up.</p>

<p>"What you ringin' that door-bell for, doctor?" said he. "The

folks ain't come home yet. There ain't nobody there."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is, Jim. I was called here last night. A man came for

me to attend his wife. They must both have fallen asleep that the

bell is not answered. I wouldn't be surprised to find her dead, as a

matter of fact. She was a desperately sick woman. Perhaps she is

dead and something has happened to him. You have the key to the

door, Jim. Let me in."</p>

<p>But the old man was shaking in every limb, and refused to do as

he was bid.</p>

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.08.jpg" n="110"/>

<p>"Don't you never go in there, doctor," whispered he, with

chattering teeth. "Don't you go for to 'tend no one. You jus' come

tell me when you sent for that way. No, I ain't goin' in, doctor,

nohow. It ain't part of my duties to go in. That's been stipulated by

Mr. Netherton. It's my business to look after the garden."</p>

<p>Argument was useless. Dr. Block took the bunch of keys from

the old man's pocket and himself unlocked the front door and

entered. He mounted the steps and made his way to the upper room.

There was no evidence of occupancy. The place was silent, and, so

far as living creature went, vacant. The dust lay over everything.   It

covered the delicate damask of the sofa where he had seen the dying

woman. It rested on the pillows. The place smelled musty and evil,

as if it had not been used for a long time. The lamps of the room

held not a drop of oil.</p>

<p>But on the mantel-shelf was the prescription which the doctor

had written the night 

<pb id="ep.gs.0009.09.jpg" n="111"/>

before. He read it, folded it, and put it in

his pocket.</p>

<p>As he locked the outside door the old gardener came running to 

him.</p>

<p>"Don't you never go up there again, will you?" he pleaded, "not

unless you see all the Nethertons home and I come for you myself.

You won't, doctor?"</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor.</p>

<p>When he told his wife she kissed him, and said:</p>

<p>"Next time when I tell you to stay at home, you must stay!"</p>
